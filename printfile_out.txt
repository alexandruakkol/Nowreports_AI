 ===================================================['[Index to Financial Statements] Changes in supply and demand for the products we handle, which can be caused by a variety of factors outside of our control, can negatively affect our operating results.', '[Note 9—Investments in Unconsolidated Entities] Although we own less than 20% of W2W Pipeline, we use the equity method to account for the investment because we believe we have significant influence over the financial and operating decisions of the company.', '[Commercial Paper Program] We have a commercial paper program under which we may issue (and have outstanding at any time) up to $2.7 billion in the aggregate of privately placed, unsecured commercial paper notes. Such notes are backstopped by our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our senior secured hedged inventory facility; as such, any borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the available capacity under these facilities.', '[Index to Financial Statements] While we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe to be reasonable and prudent, we can provide no assurance that our current levels of insurance will be sufficient to cover any losses that we have incurred or may incur in the future, whether due to deductibles, coverage challenges or other limitations. In addition, over the last several years, as the scale and scope of our business activities has expanded, the breadth and depth of available insurance markets has contracted. As a result of these factors and other market conditions, as well as the fact that we have experienced several incidents in the past, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies have increased substantially. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates or on other terms we consider commercially reasonable. In addition, although we believe that we currently maintain adequate insurance coverage, insurance will not cover many types of interruptions or events that might occur and will not cover all risks associated with our operations. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. The occurrence of a significant event, the consequences of which are either not covered by insurance or not fully insured, or a significant delay in, or denial of, the payment of a major insurance claim, could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For a discussion of our Line 901 Incident insurance receivable, please read Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates— Line 901 Incident Insurance Receivable” and Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.', '[Index to Financial Statements] We may also suffer damage (including reputational damage) as a result of a disaster, accident, catastrophe, terrorist attack or other such event. The occurrence of such an event, or a series of such events, especially if one or more of them occurs in a highly populated or sensitive area, could negatively impact public perception of our operations and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain the approvals, permits, licenses or real property interests we need in order to operate our assets or complete planned growth projects or other transactions.', '[Index to Financial Statements] Our general partner manages and operates the Partnership. If unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they currently have little practical ability to remove our general partner. Our general partner may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least 66', '[NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS] Additionally, we have elected practical expedients to exclude contracts with terms of one year or less, and therefore exclude the presentation of remaining performance obligations for short-term transportation, storage and processing services, merchant arrangements, including the non-cancelable period of evergreen arrangements, and any other types of arrangements with terms of one year or less.', '[Risks Related to Our Business] an inability to fully implement or realize expected returns or other anticipated benefits associated with joint venture and joint ownership arrangements, acquisitions, divestitures and other projects;', '[Consolidated Results] **   \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Indicates that variance as a percentage is not meaningful.', '[Index to Financial Statements] As these projects are undertaken, required approvals, permits and licenses may not be obtained, may be delayed, may be obtained with conditions that materially alter the expected return associated with the underlying projects or may be granted and then subsequently withdrawn;', '[Index to Financial Statements] We may enter into new businesses in connection with our strategy to participate in emerging energy opportunities. If we are unable to execute on this strategy or operate these new lines of business effectively, our future growth could be limited. These new lines of business may never develop or may present risks that we cannot effectively manage.', '[Cash and Cash Equivalents] Cash and cash equivalents consist of all unrestricted demand deposits and funds invested in highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less and typically exceed federally insured limits. We periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions where these funds are held and believe that our credit risk is minimal.', '[Index to Financial Statements] Acquisitions and divestitures involve risks that may adversely affect our business.']
