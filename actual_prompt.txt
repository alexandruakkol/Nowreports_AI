===========================================================[Table of Contents] The expected return on Pension Plan assets assumption of 7.0% was selected by TPL based on historical real rates of return for the current asset mix and an assumption with respect to future inflation. The rate was determined based on a long-term allocation of about two-thirds fixed income and one-third equity securities; historical real rates of return of about 2.5% and 8.5% for fixed income and equity securities, respectively; and assuming a long-term inflation rate of 2.5%.
===========================================================[Human Capital Resources] Our business strategy and ability to serve customers relies on employing talented professionals and attracting, training, developing and retaining a knowledgeable skilled workforce. We maintain a good working relationship with our employees. We value our employees and their experience in providing value through land, mineral and water resource management and water solutions. Maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our ongoing success and is a key aspect of succession planning efforts across the organization. Our leadership and human resources teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. We are committed to enhancing gender, racial and ethnic diversity throughout our organization.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] The Pension Plan has a formal investment policy statement. The Pension Plan’s investment objective is balanced income, with a moderate risk tolerance. This objective emphasizes current income through a 30.0% to 80.0% allocation to fixed income securities, complemented by a secondary consideration for capital appreciation through an equity allocation in the range of 20.0% to 60.0%. Diversification is achieved through investment in equities and bonds. The asset allocation is reviewed annually with respect to the target allocations and rebalancing adjustments and/or target allocation changes are made as appropriate. Our current funding policy is to maintain the Pension Plan’s fully funded status on an ERISA minimum funding basis.
===========================================================[Fair Value Measurements] Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
===========================================================[Fair Value Measurements] The fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, as follows:
===========================================================[Level] 1 – Inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Since inputs are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, Level 1 inputs require the least judgment.
===========================================================[Level] 2 – Inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, or are observable either directly or indirectly. Inputs are obtained from various sources including financial institutions and brokers.
===========================================================[Level] 3 – Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3.

===========================================================[The Inflation Reduction Act] On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) was signed into law and includes a number of tax-related provisions, including (i) a 15-percent book minimum tax (“AMT”) on adjusted financial statement income once the three year average of adjusted financial statement income is greater than $1.0 billion, (ii) certain clean energy tax incentives in the form of tax credits, and (iii) a one-percent excise tax on certain corporate stock buybacks (effective beginning January 1, 2023).  The Company does not anticipate that the IRA will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
===========================================================[Risks Related to our Business] The oil and gas royalties that we receive are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas. When lower market prices for oil and gas occur, they will have an adverse effect on our oil and gas royalties and vice-versa. The market prices for oil and gas are subject to US and global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions and infrastructure and logistical constraints, amongst others, and, in the past, have been subject to significant price fluctuations. Price fluctuations for oil and gas have been particularly volatile in recent years due to supply and demand fundamentals, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and Russia (collectively referred to as “OPEC+”) actions, and general economic cycles, among other factors. These measures have at times resulted in a reduction to global economic activity and volatility in the global financial markets. The scale and duration of the impact of these factors remain unknowable but could lead to an increase in our operating costs or a decrease in our revenues and have a material impact on our business segments and earnings, cash flow and financial condition.
===========================================================[9.    Earnings Per Share] Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus unvested restricted stock and other unvested awards granted pursuant to our incentive and equity compensation plans.  The computation of diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if all outstanding awards under the incentive and equity compensation plans were converted into shares of Common Stock or resulted in the issuance of shares of Common Stock that would then share in the earnings of the Company.  The number of dilutive securities is computed using the treasury stock method.

===========================================================[Risks Related to our Business] We are not an oil and gas producer.  Our revenues from oil and gas royalties are subject to the actions of others.
===========================================================[Litigation] Prior to January 1, 2022, ad valorem taxes with respect to our historical royalty interests were paid directly by certain third parties pursuant to an existing arrangement.  Since the completion of our Corporate Reorganization, we have received notice from one such third party that they no longer intend to pay the ad valorem taxes related to such historical royalty interests.  As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded an accrual of approximately $8.0 million for ad valorem taxes and intends to pay such taxes when they become due.  While we intend to seek reimbursement from the third party following payment of such taxes, we are unable to determine the likelihood of such reimbursement, and accordingly, no loss recovery receivable has been recorded as of December 31, 2022.
===========================================================[Lease Commitments] As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded right-of-use assets of $2.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and lease liabilities for $2.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, primarily related to operating leases in connection with our administrative offices located in Dallas and Midland, Texas.  The office lease agreements require monthly rent payments and expire in December 2025 and July 2027, respectively.  Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Operating lease cost for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $0.8 million.
===========================================================[Lease Commitments] While certain of our lease agreements contain covenants governing the use of the leased assets or require us to maintain certain levels of insurance, none of our lease agreements include material financial covenants or limitations. There are no residual value guarantees in our lease commitments.  The weighted-average lease term for our operating lease liabilities is approximately 44 months.

===========================================================[Corporate Reorganization] On January 11, 2021, TPL completed its Corporate Reorganization.  To implement the Corporate Reorganization, the Trust and TPL Corporation entered into agreements and undertook and caused to be undertaken a series of transactions to effect the transfer to TPL Corporation of all of the Trust’s assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Corporate Reorganization.
===========================================================[Corporate Reorganization] Prior to the market opening on January 11, 2021, the Trust distributed all of the shares of Common Stock of TPL Corporation to holders of sub-share certificates (“Sub-shares”) of the Trust, on a pro rata, one-for-one, basis in accordance with
===========================================================[Table of Contents] their interests in the Trust (the “Distribution”).  As a result of the Distribution, TPL Corporation is now a corporation with its Common Stock listed under the symbol “TPL” on the New York Stock Exchange.
===========================================================[Risks Related to our Business] We are not an oil and gas producer.  Our oil and gas income is derived primarily from perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests that we have retained. As oil and gas wells age, their production capacity may decline absent additional investment. However, the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells make all decisions as to investments in, and production from, those wells and our royalties are dependent upon decisions made by those operators, among other factors.  Accordingly, a significant portion of our revenues is reliant on the management and actions of third parties, over whom we have no control.  There can be no assurance that such third parties will take actions or make decisions that will be beneficial to us, which could result in adverse effects on our financial results and performance.
===========================================================[Stock Repurchase Program 2022 and earlier] On March 11, 2022, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to purchase up to an aggregate of $100 million of shares of our outstanding Common Stock during 2022.  In connection with the stock repurchase program, the Company entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan (the “Trading Plan”) that generally permits the Company to repurchase shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so under securities laws. Stock repurchases under the Trading Plan began April 18, 2022.  The stock repurchase program expired on December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased $87.9 million (including share repurchases not yet settled) of our outstanding Common Stock.
===========================================================[Stock Repurchase Program 2022 and earlier] For the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased $19.9 million (including share repurchases not yet settled) of our outstanding Common Stock.

===========================================================[Dividends] For the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid total cash dividends of $12.00 per share of Common Stock and special dividends of $20.00 per share of Common Stock.

===========================================================[Risks Related to our Business] Land sales vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter. The total dollar amount, the average price per acre, and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of future land sales. Our desire to sell and the demand and pricing for any particular tract of our land is influenced by many factors, including but not limited to: (i) the national and local economies, (ii) the rate of oil and gas well development by operators, (iii) the rate of residential and commercial development in nearby areas, (iv) the livestock carrying capacity, and (v) the condition of the local agricultural industry, which itself is influenced by range conditions and livestock and agricultural product pricing. Our ability to sell land can be, therefore, largely dependent on the actions of adjoining landowners.

===========================================================[14.    Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)] We measure our share of oil and gas produced in barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”).  One Boe equals one barrel of crude oil, condensate, NGLs (natural gas liquids) or approximately 6,000 cubic feet of gas. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our share of oil and gas produced was approximately 21.3, 18.6 and 16.2 thousand Boe per day, respectively.  Reserves related to our royalty interests are not presented because the information is unavailable.
===========================================================[14.    Oil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)] There are a number of oil and gas wells that have been drilled but are not yet completed (“DUC”) where we have a royalty interest.  The number of DUC wells is determined using uniform drilling spacing units with pooled interests for all wells awaiting completion.  We have identified 584, 452, and 531 DUC wells subject to our royalty interest as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

===========================================================[Risks Related to our Business] Demand for TPWR’s products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ overall financial position, capital allocation priorities, and views of future oil and natural gas prices.  Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which would adversely affect our earnings, cash flow and financial condition.

===========================================================[successfully] The business of TPWR is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including laws and regulations on water use, environmental and safety matters. These laws and regulations may increase the costs and timing of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning water wells, source water and treatment facilities and impact our customers’ ability to transport and/or store produced water in certain locations. Due to increased seismicity in the Delaware and Midland Basins, the Texas Railroad Commission recently began implementing Seismic Response Areas (“SRAs”) limiting the permitted capacity and use of certain Saltwater Disposal Wells (“SWDs”) for the injection of produced water.  The implementation of SRAs could limit the volume of produced water disposed on the Company’s surface within the SRAs or, in certain cases, could direct additional volumes of produced water to SWDs on the Company’s surface outside of SRAs.  These limitations and/or redirections may cause TPWR to change its business plans and could affect TPWR’s financial performance. The Company continues to actively engage with the Texas Railroad Commission and evaluate the potential effect of SRAs on the Company’s produced water royalties.

===========================================================[successfully] Much of the value of the land we own and upon which we receive royalties is based on the oil and natural gas reserves located there. Our revenues may be negatively affected by changes driven by trends such as decarbonization efforts.  Such changes may relate to the types or sources of energy in demand, such as a shift to renewable sources of power generation (for example, wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in regulatory, investor, customer and consumer policies and preferences.  The evolution of global energy sources is affected by factors out of our control, such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies. In addition, the possibility of taxes on carbon emissions can affect the demand for crude oil and natural gas and the operating costs for third party operators on our royalty properties.

===========================================================[successfully] Cyber incidents or attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection of our data, our business may be adversely impacted.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We and our operators increasingly rely on information technology systems to operate our respective businesses, and the oil and gas industry depends on digital technologies in exploration, development, production, and processing activities. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of the operators on our properties, vendors, suppliers, and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary, personal and other information, or other disruption of business activities. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for some period of time. While we utilize various systems, procedures and controls to mitigate exposure to such risk, cyber incidents and attacks are continually evolving and unpredictable. Our information technology systems and any insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that our business, finances, systems and assets will not be compromised in a cyber attack.

===========================================================[Table of Contents] The successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team, including with respect to the business of TPWR. The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. If we cannot retain our experienced personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Global health threats, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our business.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent and continuing outbreak of COVID-19. A significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population and resulting widespread health crisis could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn, reduced demand for oil and gas and interruption to supply chains related to oil and gas. The reduction of economic activity and reduced global demand for oil and gas related to COVID-19 and actions taken by governments to mitigate the spread of the virus could lead to an increase in our operating costs and have a material impact on our business segments and earnings, cash flow and financial condition.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We face direct and indirect supply chain risks that may adversely affect our business.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our business could be negatively affected by supply shortages and/or price increases driven by the increased costs of materials and logistics as a result of macroeconomic conditions, including the prolonged Ukraine/Russia conflict, general inflationary pressures, labor shortages, part or equipment availability, manufacturing capacity, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters or pandemics and the effects of climate change.  Supply shortages and/or price increases could lead to a reduction in revenues and an increase in our operating costs and could have a material impact on our business segments and earnings, cash flow and financial condition.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Supply chain issues may disrupt the operations and development activities of operators on our land, upon whom much of our revenue relies, which could negatively affect our revenues from oil and gas royalties, easements and our water offerings.  Supply chain issues could also lead to an increase in TPWR’s operating costs and disrupt its water sourcing and treatment operations, which could further negatively affect our revenues from our water offerings. TPWR has adapted lead times for ordering parts and equipment to mitigate supply chain issues, but given the uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic factors and geopolitical situation, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer adverse effects on our business operations in the future.
===========================================================[Risks Related to the Corporate Reorganization] The completion of the Corporate Reorganization may implicate conditions and covenants contained in certain agreements to which the Trust was a party and thereby may cause us to lose certain benefits that the Trust historically received. If the Company is unable to obtain consents to, or approval or waiver of, any such conditions or covenants, or is unable to obtain an acknowledgement that any such benefits shall continue for the benefit of TPL Corporation, we may not be entitled to all benefits and other rights under such agreements, which may have an adverse impact on the business and results of operations.
===========================================================[No] If securities are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act, indicate by check mark whether the financial statements of the registrant included in the filing reflect the correction of an error to previously issued financial statements.
===========================================================[Risks Related to the Corporate Reorganization] The completion of the Corporate Reorganization may implicate conditions and covenants, contained in certain agreements to which the Trust was, and now TPL Corporation is, a party and thereby may cause us to lose certain benefits that
===========================================================[Table of Contents] the Trust historically received. Certain counterparties may withhold consent to, or approval or waiver of, certain conditions or covenants in order to obtain more favorable terms from us.  If the Company is unable to obtain consents to, or approval or waiver of, any such conditions or covenants, or if the Company is unable to obtain acknowledgement from any counterparties that any such benefits shall continue for the benefit of TPL Corporation, then we may decide to enforce our rights and interests by initiating legal action. In the meantime, and pending the outcome of any such legal proceeding to enforce our rights, we may be unable to continue to obtain all benefits and other rights under such agreements that would otherwise be transferred to us as part of the Corporate Reorganization. This may have an adverse impact on TPL’s business and results of operations.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] For example, the obligation to pay ad valorem taxes with respect to certain of our royalty interests was assumed by a third party and is now the obligation of the successors in interest to such third party (the “obligors”), so long as such royalty interests are held by the Trustees or their successors in office under the Declaration of Trust. The amount of such taxes depends on the valuations determined by various county taxing authorities with respect to our royalty interests and the tax rates used in assessing such ad valorem taxes. Consequently, the amount of ad valorem taxes that may be assessed against our royalty interests may vary from year to year, and we are unable to reliably predict the amount of any such increases or decreases in future years. We have received an indication from one such obligor that it does not intend to continue to make the ad valorem tax payments that it has been making to date.  We have accrued an estimate of such taxes and are making payments on a current basis in order to protect the royalty interests from any potential tax liens for nonpayment of future ad valorem taxes. While we intend to seek reimbursement from the third party following payment of such taxes, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in getting reimbursed. Taking on the cost of such payments will have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] The Corporate Reorganization may have adverse tax consequences.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We have obtained an opinion from counsel that the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution qualified as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code. The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution. The opinion assumed that the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution was completed according to the terms of certain of the operative agreements and required regulatory filings, and relied on the facts as stated therein and in other ancillary agreements and documents. In addition, the opinion was based on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by, us and the Trust. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants were incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or were violated in any material respect.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] The opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and no assurance can be given that contrary positions will not be taken by the IRS or a court. We have not sought and will not seek a ruling from the IRS regarding the federal income tax consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] If the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution were to fail to qualify as a reorganization or for tax-free treatment either under Section 368(a)(1)(F) or any other provision of the Code, then U.S. Holders of Sub-shares would recognize gain or loss, as applicable, equal to the difference between (a) the sum of the fair market value of the shares of TPL Corporation Common Stock received by such holder and (b) its adjusted tax basis in the Sub-shares surrendered in exchange therefor. Further, the Trust would recognize taxable gain as if it sold all of its assets, subject to its liabilities, at fair market value. The consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution to any holder will depend on that holder’s particular situation.
===========================================================[Risks Related to Our Common Stock] We cannot be certain that an active trading market for our Common Stock will be sustained, and our stock price may fluctuate significantly.
===========================================================[Risks Related to Our Common Stock] A public market for our Common Stock did not exist until the Corporate Reorganization was effected on January 11, 2021.  We cannot guarantee that the active trading market that has developed will be sustained for our Common Stock, nor can we predict the prices at which shares of our Common Stock may trade.
===========================================================[Risks Related to Our Common Stock] Until the market has fully evaluated our business as a corporation, the prices at which shares of our Common Stock trade may fluctuate more significantly than might otherwise be typical, even with other market conditions, including general volatility, held constant. The increased volatility of our stock price following the Corporate Reorganization may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:

===========================================================[Risks Related to Our Common Stock] actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate;

===========================================================[Table of Contents] the failure of securities analysts to cover, or positively cover, our Common Stock;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] actual or anticipated fluctuations in commodities prices; and
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Investors in the Trust may have held Sub-shares because of a decision to invest in an organization with the Trust’s governance profile or operating track record. Now that the Corporate Reorganization has occurred, the shares of our Common Stock held by those investors will represent an investment in a company with a different governance profile, in particular a board of directors at TPL Corporation subject to changes from year to year at annual elections of directors serving staggered three-year terms. More frequent changes in the leadership of the organization, particularly on the Board, could lead to changes in the operating policies of TPL Corporation over time. Such changes may not match some stockholders’ investment strategies, which could cause them to sell our Common Stock. These changes may also attract new investors who previously did not invest in the Trust because of its structure, governance profile or operating track record. As a result of such changes, our stock price may decline or experience volatility as our stockholder base changes. Additionally, new investors or leadership at TPL Corporation could advocate for business or corporate initiatives that would not be beneficial for all stockholders, such as an untimely sale of the business.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activists.
===========================================================[No] Indicate by check mark whether the registrant is a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act). Yes
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy, and impact the trading value of our securities. In the past, the Company has been the subject of stockholder activism, and we are subject to the risks associated with any ongoing or future such activism. Stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and our Board, potentially interfering with our ability to execute our strategic plan. We may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist stockholder matters, and the attention of our management may be diverted by such activism. While we welcome our stockholders’ constructive input, there can be no assurance that stockholder actions would not result in negative impacts to the Company. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and the market price of our Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by stockholder activism.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] If stockholders were to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allowing the issuance of additional equity, holders of our Common Stock could experience dilution in the future.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] If stockholders were to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allowing the issuance of additional equity, holders of our Common Stock could be diluted because of equity issuances for proposed acquisitions or capital market transactions or equity awards proposed to be granted to our directors, officers and employees subject to any required vote of holders of our Common Stock under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. We may issue stock-based awards, including annual awards, new hire awards and periodic retention awards, as applicable, to our directors, officers and other employees under any employee benefits plans we have adopted or may adopt, using newly issued shares rather than treasury shares as is currently our practice.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more series of preferred stock having such designations, powers, preferences, privileges and relative, participating, optional and special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the Board may generally determine in
===========================================================[Table of Contents] its sole discretion. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our Common Stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of the members of the Board in all events or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Common Stock.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We may not continue the Trust’s historical practice of declaring cash dividends. We will evaluate whether to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock in the future and we cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends, if any.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] The timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any cash dividends to our stockholders is within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with any debt service obligations or other contractual obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Moreover, should our Board determine to pay any dividend in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We may not continue the Trust’s historical practice of repurchasing outstanding equity of its holders. We will evaluate whether to repurchase our outstanding Common Stock in the future and we cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of share repurchases, if any.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 48,959 outstanding shares of Common Stock which repurchased shares were placed in treasury.  We expect that we will from time to time offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding Common Stock. However, any repurchase will be within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our Common Stock, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements and the nature of other investment opportunities.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] State law and anti-takeover provisions could enable our Board to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our stockholders.
===========================================================[No] The aggregate market value of the common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of the last business day of the registrant’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter (June 30, 2022) was approximately $8.5 billion.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: (a) the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on our Board (except in an instance where a director is removed by stockholders and the resulting vacancy is filled by stockholders); (b) the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; (c) rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and (d) the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that you may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the Company immune from takeovers; however, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas as the sole and exclusive forums for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the Company otherwise determines, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware) or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, any

===========================================================[Overview] TPL was originally organized in 1888 as a business trust to hold title to extensive tracts of land in numerous counties in West Texas which were previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.  As discussed in Item 1. “Business — General — Corporate Reorganization,” on January 11, 2021, we completed our Corporate Reorganization from a business trust to a corporation changing our name from Texas Pacific Land Trust to Texas Pacific Land Corporation.
===========================================================[Overview] For an overview of our business and discussion of our business segments, see Item 1. “Business — General.”
===========================================================[Overview] Our business activity is generated from our surface and royalty interest ownership in West Texas, primarily in the Permian Basin.  Our revenues are derived from oil, gas and produced water royalties, sales of water and land, easements and commercial leases.  Due to the nature of our operations and concentration of our ownership in one geographic location, our revenue and net income are subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year.  In addition to fluctuations in response to changes in the market price for oil and gas, our financial results are also subject to decisions by the owners and operators of not only the oil and gas wells to which our oil and gas royalty interests relate, but also to other owners and operators in the Permian Basin as it relates to our other revenue streams, principally water sales, easements and other surface-related revenue.
===========================================================[Global Oil and Natural Gas Market Impact in 2022] Average oil and gas prices during 2022 were strong compared to average prices in previous years over the last decade.  Oil prices were impacted by continued oil supply cuts by OPEC+, an uneven global demand recovery, and Russia’s incursion into Ukraine, among other factors.  In response to high oil prices during 2022, the United States (“US”) implemented various measures to help mitigate potential supply shortfalls and high oil prices, most notably by releasing millions of barrels of crude oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The confluence of these major events has contributed to fluctuations in oil prices during 2022. Global and domestic natural gas markets have also experienced volatility due to macroeconomic conditions, infrastructure and logistical constraints, and geopolitical issues, among other factors. US natural gas prices at Henry Hub, located in Erath, Louisiana, have strengthened in 2021 and 2022 due in part to liquified natural gas prices (“LNG”) exports and local demand for power, heating, and industrial activity. In 2022, the Waha Hub located in Pecos County, Texas, at times experienced significant negative price differentials relative to Henry Hub due in part to growing local Permian natural gas production gas and limited natural gas pipeline takeaway capacity. Inflation remains elevated and continues to significantly impact current labor costs and supplies. Changes in macro-economic conditions, including rising interest rates and lower global economic activity, could result in additional shifts in demand and supply in future periods.  Although our revenues are directly and indirectly impacted by changes in oil prices, we believe our royalty interests (which require no capital expenditures or operating expense burden from us for well development), strong balance sheet, and liquidity position will help us navigate through potential oil price volatility.
===========================================================[COVID-19 Pandemic] We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are following local government mandates, where applicable, and will continue to revise and refine our on-site work to ensure business continuity and the safety and well-being of our employees. The full extent to which the pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments that are highly
===========================================================[Table of Contents] uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity, and new variants, of the virus.
===========================================================[Permian Basin Activity] The Permian Basin is one of the oldest and most well-known hydrocarbon-producing areas and currently accounts for a substantial portion of oil and gas production in the United States, covering approximately 86,000 square miles in 52 counties across southeastern New Mexico and western Texas.  Exploration and production (“E&P”) companies active in the Permian have generally increased their drilling and development activity in 2022 compared to recent prior year activity levels. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), Permian production is currently in excess of five million barrels per day, which is higher than the average daily production of any year prior to 2022.  Despite record Permian production volumes, E&P companies continue to experience challenges with labor and supply chains related to drilling and completion activities, which could negatively impact overall production.
===========================================================[Permian Basin Activity] With our ownership concentration in the Permian Basin, our revenues are directly impacted by oil and gas pricing and drilling activity in the Permian Basin.  Below are metrics for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

===========================================================[Permian Basin Activity] Permian Basin for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our oil and gas royalties are impacted by both oil and gas prices as well as production levels.  Oil and gas prices in 2022 have significantly increased compared to the comparable period in 2021. Although E&P companies broadly continue to deploy capital at a measured pace, drilling and development activities across the Permian have generally improved in 2022 compared to the prior year. As we are a significant landowner in the Permian Basin and not an oil and gas producer, our revenue is affected by the development decisions made by companies that operate in the areas where we own royalty interests and land. Accordingly, these decisions made by others affect not only our production and produced water disposal volumes, but also directly impact our surface-related income and water sales.
===========================================================[Overview] Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash flows generated from our operations.  Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for capital expenditures related to our Water Services and Operations segment (the extent and timing of which are under our control), working capital and general corporate needs.

===========================================================[Table of Contents] We continuously review our liquidity and capital resources.  If market conditions were to change and our revenues were to decline significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced.  Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding.  We have no debt or credit facilities, nor any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $510.8 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business, to repurchase our Common Stock subject to market conditions, to pay dividends subject to the discretion of our Board and for general corporate purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased $87.9 million of our Common Stock (including share repurchases not yet settled), and we paid $247.3 million in dividends to our stockholders. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents balances, will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] During the year ended December 31, 2022, we invested approximately $18.6 million in Texas Pacific Water Resources LLC (“TPWR”) projects to maintain and/or enhance water sourcing assets, of which $6.9 million related to electrifying our water sourcing infrastructure.
===========================================================[Cash Flows from Operating Activities] For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $447.1 million and $265.2 million, respectively.  Our cash flow provided by operating activities is primarily from oil, gas and produced water royalties, water and land sales, and easements and other surface-related income. Cash flow used in operations generally consists of operating expenses associated with our revenue streams, general and administrative expenses and income taxes.
===========================================================[Cash Flows from Operating Activities] The increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021, was primarily related to increased prices and volumes of oil and gas production and was partially offset by increased income tax payments.
===========================================================[Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities] For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $21.4 million and $15.0 million, respectively.  Our cash flows used in investing activities are primarily related to capital expenditures related to our water services and operations segment and acquisitions of royalty interests.
===========================================================[Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities] Capital expenditures increased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021. Acquisitions of royalty interests increased approximately $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period 2021.
===========================================================[Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities] For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $336.8 million and $104.9 million, respectively.  Our cash flows used in financing principally consist of activities which return capital to our stockholders such as payment of dividends and repurchases of our Common Stock.
===========================================================[Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities] During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid total dividends of $247.3 million, consisting of cumulative paid cash dividends of $12.00 per share and special dividends of $20.00 per share.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid total dividends of $85.3 million consisting of cumulative cash dividends of $11.00 per share. We repurchased $87.9 million and $19.9 million of our Common Stock (including share repurchases not yet settled) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

===========================================================[Consolidated Revenues and Net Income:] Total revenues increased $216.5 million, or 48.0%, to $667.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $451.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was principally due to the $166.0 million increase in oil and gas royalties and the combined increase of $31.1 million in water sales and produced water royalties over the same period.  Net income of $446.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 65.3% higher than the comparable period of 2021. The increase in net income was driven by the 55.2% increase in operating income resulting from the 48.0% increase in total revenues and the 3.9% improvement in operating margin to 84.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year.  Individual revenue line items are discussed below under “Segment Results of Operations.”
===========================================================[Salaries and related employee expenses] .  Salaries and related employee expenses were $41.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $40.0 million for the comparable period of 2021.  Stock compensation expense for the
===========================================================[Table of Contents] year ended December 31, 2022 was $7.6 million.  As noted in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Share-Based Compensation,” the Company recognizes share-based compensation expense using the graded-vesting method which impacts the timing of the recognition of stock compensation expense for stock awards with vesting periods in excess of one year.  Prior to December 2021, the Company did not have an equity incentive plan and did not pay compensation in equity. Salaries and related employee expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included $6.7 million of severance costs.
===========================================================[Water service-related expenses] . Water service-related expenses increased $4.2 million to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.  Transfer and treatment expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased primarily due to heightened sales activity compared to the same period of 2021.  Since the beginning of 2021, we have invested $13.3 million of capital in electrifying our water-related infrastructure to minimize our reliance on diesel-powered generators.  Electricity expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased principally due to increased usage of our electrified infrastructure and rising electricity costs compared to the same period of 2021.  This increase in electricity expense was partially offset by decreases in fuel and equipment rental expenses during the same time period.
===========================================================[General and administrative expenses.] General and administrative expenses increased $1.6 million to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $11.8 million for the same period of 2021.  The increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021 was principally related to increases in charitable contributions, corporate insurance and board expenses due to the expansion of our board to 10 directors.
===========================================================[Legal and professional fees] .  Legal and professional fees were $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $7.3 million for the comparable period of 2021.  The increase is principally related to legal expenses associated with stockholder matters.
===========================================================[Ad valorem taxes] .  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an expense of $8.7 million for ad valorem taxes.  Prior to January 1, 2022, ad valorem taxes with respect to our historical royalty interests were paid directly by certain third parties pursuant to an existing arrangement.  Since the completion of our Corporate Reorganization on January 11, 2021, we have received notice from one such third party that they no longer intend to pay the ad valorem taxes related to such historical royalty interests.  While we continue to believe the obligation to pay these ad valorem taxes should belong to the third party, we have accrued an estimate of such taxes and intend to pay the taxes when they become due in order to protect the royalty interests from any potential tax liens for nonpayment of future ad valorem taxes. While we intend to seek reimbursement from the third party following payment of such taxes, we are unable to determine the likelihood of such reimbursement, and accordingly, have not recorded a loss recovery receivable as of December 31, 2022.

===========================================================[Other income, net.] Other income, net was $6.5 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Interest income earned on our cash balances increased as interest yields rose during 2022.
===========================================================[Total income tax expense.] Total income tax expense was $122.5 million and $93.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in income tax expense is primarily related to increased operating income resulting from increased revenues from oil and gas royalties and water sales.
===========================================================[Segment Results of Operations] We operate our business in two reportable segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations. We eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation.
===========================================================[Segment Results of Operations] We evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results. The reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in Note 12, “Business Segment Reporting” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We monitor our reporting segments based upon revenue and net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
===========================================================[Segment Results of Operations] Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 have benefited directly and indirectly from a rebound in oil and gas activity in the Permian Basin and increases in commodity prices compared to 2021. Our oil and gas royalties  have increased due to increased royalty production and higher commodity prices during this time period. Additionally, revenues derived from easements and other surface-related income, water sales, and produced water royalties have also generally been positively impacted by ongoing development activity in the Permian Basin.

The increase in Land and Resource Management segment revenues is principally due to the $166.0 million increase in oil and gas royalties for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the comparable period of 2021.
===========================================================[Oil and gas royalties] . Oil and gas royalties were $452.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $286.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 57.9%.

MBbls represents one thousand barrels of crude oil, condensate or NGLs.  Mcf represents one thousand cubic feet of natural gas.  MMcf represents one million cubic feet of natural gas.  MBoe represents one thousand Boe.  MBoe/d represents one thousand Boe per day.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our share of crude oil, natural gas and NGL production volumes was 21.3 thousand Boe per day for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 18.6 thousand Boe per day for the same period of 2021.  The average realized prices were $94.69 per barrel of oil, $6.19 per Mcf of natural gas, and $34.25 per barrel of NGL, for a total equivalent price of $60.81 per Boe for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $16.67 per Boe compared to the total equivalent price of $44.14 per Boe for the same period of 2021.
===========================================================[Easements and other surface-related income.] Easements and other surface-related income was $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 35.5% compared to $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.  Easements and other surface-related income includes revenue related to the use and crossing of our land for oil and gas exploration and production, renewable energy, and agricultural operations.  The increase in easements and other surface-related income is principally related to increases of $4.5 million in wellbore easements, $3.7 million in material sales, and $2.8 million in pipeline easement income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.  Easements and other surface-related income is dependent on development decisions made by companies that operate in the areas where we own land and is, therefore, unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.  See “Market Conditions” above for additional discussion of development activity in the Permian Basin during the year ended December 31, 2022.
===========================================================[Land sales and other operating revenue] .  Land sales and other operating revenue includes revenue generated from land sales and grazing leases and was $10.0 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 6,392 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of $9.7 million or approximately $1,515 per acre.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 30 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately $0.7 million, or approximately $25,000 per acre.
===========================================================[Net income.] Net income for the Land and Resource Management segment was $365.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $208.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.  Expenses, including income tax expense, for the Land and Resource Management segment were $141.9 million and $111.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The increase in expenses during 2022 is principally related to a $24.0 million
===========================================================[Table of Contents] increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.  Expenses are discussed further above under “Results of Operations.”
===========================================================[Water Services and Operations] Water Services and Operations segment revenues increased 22.9%, to $160.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared with revenues of $130.6 million for the comparable period of 2021.  The increase in Water Services and Operations segment revenues is due to increases in water sales revenue and produced water royalties, which are discussed below.  As discussed in “Market Conditions” above, our segment revenues are directly influenced by development decisions made by our customers and the overall activity level in the Permian Basin.  Accordingly, our segment revenues and sales volumes, as further discussed below, will fluctuate from period to period based upon those decisions and activity levels.
===========================================================[General] Texas Pacific Land Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as “TPL”, the “Company”, “our”, “we” or “us”) is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately 874,000 surface acres of land in West Texas, with the majority of our ownership concentrated in the Permian Basin.  Additionally, we own a 1/128th nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest (“NPRI”) under approximately 85,000 acres of land, a 1/16th NPRI under approximately 371,000 acres of land, and  approximately 4,000 additional net royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th), all located in the western part of Texas.
===========================================================[Water sales] .  Water sales revenue increased $17.0 million, or 25.0% to $84.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.  The increase in water sales is principally due to an increase of approximately 10.3% in sourced and treated water sales volumes for the years ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
===========================================================[Produced water royalties.] Produced water royalties are received from the transfer or disposal of produced water on our land. Produced water royalties are contractual and not paid as a matter of right. We do not operate any salt water disposal wells.  Produced water royalties were $72.2 million  for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $58.1 million for the same period in 2021.  This increase is principally due to increased produced water volumes for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.
===========================================================[Easements and other surface-related income] .  Easements and other surface-related income was $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $1.2 million compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.  The decrease in easements and other surface-related income relates to a decrease in temporary permits for sourced water lines for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.
===========================================================[Net income] .  Net income for the Water Services and Operations segment was $81.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $61.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.  As discussed above, revenues for the Water Services and Operations segment increased 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period of 2021.  Expenses, including income tax expense, for the Water Services and Operations segment were $79.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.  The overall increase in segment expenses during 2022 is principally related to a $5.4 million increase in income tax expense and a $4.2 million increase in water service-related expenses resulting from increased segment revenue and operating income during the same time period.  Expenses are discussed further above under “Results of Operations.”
===========================================================[Non-GAAP Performance Measures] In addition to amounts presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP measurements.  These measurements are not to be considered more relevant or accurate than the measurements presented in accordance with GAAP.  In compliance with the requirements of the SEC, our non-GAAP measurements are reconciled to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure.  For all non-GAAP measurements, neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on these non-GAAP measurements.
===========================================================[EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA] EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization.  Its purpose is to highlight earnings without finance, taxes, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and its use is limited to specialized analysis.  We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding employee share-based compensation, conversion costs related to our Corporate Reorganization, and severance costs.  Its purpose is to highlight earnings without non-cash activity such as share-based compensation and/or other non-recurring or unusual items such as conversion and severance costs.  We have presented EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that both are useful supplements to net income in analyzing operating performance.

===========================================================[General] The Company was originally organized as Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”) under a Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888, to receive and hold title to extensive tracts of land in the State of Texas, previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.   The Declaration of Trust provided for the appointment of trustees (the “Trustees”) to manage the assets of the Trust with all of the powers of an absolute owner.  On January 11, 2021, the Trust completed its reorganization from a business trust, Texas Pacific Land Trust, into Texas Pacific Land Corporation (“TPL Corporation”), a corporation formed and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. TPL Corporation is now an independent public company and its Common Stock is listed under the symbol “TPL” on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). See further discussion under “Corporate Reorganization” below.  Any references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the Company, TPL, our, we or us with respect to periods prior to January 11, 2021, will be in reference to the Trust, and references to periods on that date and thereafter will be in reference to Texas Pacific Land Corporation or TPL Corporation.

===========================================================[Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates] The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. It is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consistent with our disclosure policies, we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.
===========================================================[Accrual of Oil and Gas Royalties] The Company accrues oil and gas royalties.  An accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the production of oil and gas and generation of the actual payment by operators.  The oil and gas royalty accrual is based upon historical production volumes, estimates of the timing of future payments and recent market prices for oil and gas.
===========================================================[New Accounting Pronouncements] For further information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
===========================================================[General] Our surface and royalty ownership provide revenue opportunities throughout the oil and gas development value chain.  While we are not an oil and gas producer, we benefit from various revenue sources throughout the life cycle of a well.  During the initial development phase where infrastructure for oil and gas development is constructed, we receive fixed fee payments for use of our land and revenue for sales of materials (caliche) used in the construction of the infrastructure. During the drilling and completion phase, we generate revenue for providing sourced and/or treated produced water in addition to fixed fee payments for use of our land.  During the production phase, we receive revenue from our oil and gas royalty interests and also revenues related to saltwater disposal on our land.  In addition, we generate revenue from pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases and temporary permits principally related to a variety of land uses, including midstream infrastructure projects and processing facilities as hydrocarbons are processed and transported to market.
===========================================================[Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.] The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents (consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills and commercial paper), accounts payable and other liabilities and the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

===========================================================[Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting] We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Texas Pacific Land Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
===========================================================[Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)] issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
===========================================================[Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)] We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
===========================================================[Basis for Opinion] The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Representation Letter. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
===========================================================[Basis for Opinion] We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
===========================================================[Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting] A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
===========================================================[Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting] Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

===========================================================[Code of Business Conduct and Ethics] The Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all members of the Board, executive officers and employees.  A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the Company’s corporate website at www.TexasPacific.com. The information contained on our website is not part of this Report. We intend to disclose any amendment to, or waiver of, a provision of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC.
===========================================================[Communication with Directors] The Board is committed to meaningful engagement with stockholders and other interested persons and welcomes input and suggestions. Information regarding how stockholders can contact the Co-Chairs or non-management members of the Board is set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines that are posted on our website, www.TexasPacific.com. Stockholders and other interested persons who wish to contact the Board may do so by submitting any communications to the Company by mail at 1700 Pacific Avenue, Suite 2900, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Investor Relations.
===========================================================[Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight] Mr. Norris and Mr. Barry jointly serve as chairs of the Board (together, the “Co-Chairs”). The Co-Chairs of the Board are independent directors. The Company believes that having an independent chair or independent Co-Chairs of the Board will provide strong leadership for the Board and help ensure critical and independent thinking with respect to the Company’s strategy and performance. Our Chief Executive Officer is also expected to serve as a member of the Board as the management representative. The Company believes this is important to make information and insight directly available to the directors in their deliberations. This structure gives the Company an appropriate, well-functioning balance between non-management and management directors that combines experience, accountability, and effective risk oversight. The duties of the Chair or Co-Chairs are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and include chairing Board meetings and meetings of stockholders, except as otherwise provided by our Bylaws, establishing the agenda for each Board meeting, leading executive sessions of the Board (if the Chair or Co-Chairs qualify as independent), having authority to call Board meetings, approving meeting schedules for the Board and information distributed to the Board, consulting with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with regard to the membership and performance evaluations of the Board and committee members, and performing such other duties and responsibilities as requested by the Board.
===========================================================[Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight] Our Corporate Governance Guidelines allow for the Chair of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer roles to be filled by a single individual. In the event the Chair does not qualify as independent, the independent directors shall select from among themselves a lead independent director, or only one of the Co-Chairs qualifies as independent, the independent Co-Chair
===========================================================[Table of Contents] shall also serve the functions of the lead independent director. The duties of a lead independent director are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and include chairing Board meetings in the absence of the Chair or Co-Chairs, convening and leading executive sessions of the Board, serving as a liaison between the Chair or Co-Chairs and the independent directors, being available for consultation and director communication with major stockholders as directed by the Board, and performing such other duties and responsibilities as requested by the Board.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] The Company believes that risk oversight is the responsibility of the Board as a whole and not solely of any one of its committees. The Board periodically reviews the processes established by management to identify and manage risks and communicates with management about these processes. In addition to these measures, the Audit Committee regularly discusses policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, the Company’s major litigation and financial risk exposures, compliance, cybersecurity, information technology and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and the Compensation Committee oversees risks arising from the Company’s compensation and employee benefits plans, policies and programs for its employees.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with assistance from the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, oversees our ESG program and monitors related risks. The Board, and the various committee chairs, address any issues identified in such discussions and reviews with management as they arise, and monitors actions, procedures or processes implemented in response.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Our General Counsel serves as our chief compliance officer, and periodically reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s compliance programs and responds to, and monitors the status and response to, compliance issues that may arise from time to time. The General Counsel reports to the Chief Executive Officer.
===========================================================[Corporate Reorganization] Prior to the Corporate Reorganization, as a result of a proxy contest mounted by certain holders of Sub-shares, the Trust entered into a stockholders’ agreement dated as of December 14, 2020, with Horizon Kinetics LLC, Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC (together with Horizon Kinetics LLC and its affiliates, “Horizon”), SoftVest Advisors, LLC, SoftVest, L.P. (together with SoftVest Advisors, LLC and its affiliates, “SoftVest”), and Mission Advisors, LP, (as amended to date, the “Stockholders’ Agreement”), providing for, among other things, the appointment of Dana F. McGinnis, Eric L. Oliver and Murray Stahl as directors of TPL’s board of directors (the “Board”) in connection with the Corporate Reorganization. Mr. McGinnis resigned from the Board in March 2022.
===========================================================[Audit Committee Procedures; Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions] The Audit Committee meets separately and periodically with the Company’s independent auditor, the Company’s chief financial officer and a representative of the internal audit function to assess certain matters, including the status of the independent audit process, management and the independent auditor’s assessments of the Company’s financial reporting and internal controls and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and management’s views as to the competence, performance and independence of the independent auditor.  The Audit Committee oversees the internal audit function, including its structure, personnel, budget, and annual internal audit plans.  In addition, the Audit Committee, as a whole, reviews and meets to discuss the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management and the independent auditor. The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to the Board each year as to whether the annual audited financial statements should be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.
===========================================================[Audit Committee Procedures; Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions] Information about the procedures for approval of related person transactions is available below in Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence — Transactions with Related Persons.”
===========================================================[Qualifications and Nominations of Directors] The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter provides that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee screen, recruit and interview individuals that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes are qualified to become members of the Board, consistent with criteria approved by the Board from time to time, and to recommend to the Board the (a) director nominees to be selected by the Board to stand for election or re-election at the annual meeting of stockholders and (b) director candidates to be appointed by the Board to fill vacancies and newly created directorships. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews periodically the size of the Board and oversees an annual self-evaluation of the Board and its committees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
===========================================================[Qualifications and Nominations of Directors] Whenever the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee concludes, based on the reviews or considerations described above or due to a vacancy, that a new nominee to the Board is required or advisable, it will consider recommendations from directors, management, stockholders and, if it deems appropriate, consultants retained for that purpose. In such circumstances, it will evaluate individuals recommended by stockholders in the same manner as nominees recommended from other sources. Stockholders who wish to nominate an individual for election as a director directly, without going through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, must comply with the procedures in the Company’s amended and restated bylaws.  The Company’s amended and restated bylaws are provided on our website at www.TexasPacific.com.
===========================================================[Qualifications and Nominations of Directors] Our Board has adopted a “majority vote policy.” Under this policy any nominee for director in an uncontested election who does not receive a majority of the votes cast is required to tender his or her resignation following certification of the
===========================================================[Table of Contents] stockholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the tendered resignation and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation.
===========================================================[Insider Trading Policy; Anti-Hedging Policy] We have an Insider Trading Policy that sets forth terms, conditions, timing, limitations, and prohibitions with respect to trading in the Company’s securities. The Insider Trading Policy prohibits all employees, executive officers, directors, agents, consultants and contractors from trading in the Company’s securities while in possession of material nonpublic information. Such persons are also generally prohibited from hedging, including engaging in publicly-traded options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments relating to the Company’s securities, or selling the Company’s securities “short.” The Insider Trading Policy also requires that such persons obtain pre-approval from the Company’s General Counsel for all pledges, and the deposit in margin accounts, of the Company’s securities and the securities of any other company designated by the Company’s General Counsel. The Insider Trading Policy also restricts directors, officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and certain other specifically designated employees from trading in the Company’s securities during certain periods and only after they have obtained pre-clearance for trades in the Company’s securities from the Company’s General Counsel (or, in the case of the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer).
===========================================================[Clawback Policy] In 2022, the Company adopted a Clawback Policy in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and Rule 10D-1 promulgated thereunder (collectively, “Section 10D”). In the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any such financial reporting requirement, the Clawback Policy requires that covered executives must reimburse the Company, or forfeit, any excess incentive compensation received by such covered executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare the restatement. Executives covered by the Clawback Policy are current and former executive officers, as determined by the Board in accordance with Section 10D and the listing standards of the NYSE. Incentive compensation subject to the Clawback Policy includes any cash or equity compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure as defined in Section 10D. The amount subject to recovery is the excess of the incentive compensation received based on the erroneous data over the incentive compensation that would have been received had it been based on the restated results.
===========================================================[Board of Directors] The Board currently consists of ten (10) directors, nine (9) of whom - Mr. Barry, Mr. Best, Gen. Cook, Ms. Duganier, Ms. Epps, Mr. Kurz, Mr. Norris, Mr. Oliver and Mr. Stahl - are considered “independent” under the rules of the SEC and the NYSE. No director may be deemed independent unless the Board determines that he or she has no material relationship with TPL. Mr. Norris and Mr. Barry are the Co-Chairs of the Board. Given their extensive experience as Trustees of the Trust, Mr. Norris and Mr. Barry are uniquely suited to lead the Board with their deep understanding of the Company’s business and institutional knowledge about the Company. Neither Mr. Norris nor Mr. Barry serves on any committee of the Board; instead, they devote their time and efforts to establishing the Board’s agendas and materials, working with management, coordinating activities with the committees of the Board, and transferring their knowledge of the Company’s business to the other members of the Board.
===========================================================[Board of Directors] The Board meets at least quarterly and the independent directors serving on the Board intend to meet in executive session (i.e., without the presence of any non-independent directors and management) immediately following regularly scheduled Board meetings. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (the “Last Fiscal Year”), the Board met ten (10) times and acted one (1) time by unanimous written consent in lieu of holding a meeting. All of the directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings held by the Board and of the committees on which they served during the Last Fiscal Year. Each director is also expected to attend the Company’s annual meetings of stockholders.

===========================================================[Key Aspects of 2022 Design] Enhance the structure of the program to create more transparency for participants and stockholders about how outcomes are determined and increase the risk profile of the program;
===========================================================[Key Aspects of 2022 Design] Meet common governance standards for public companies, and assess and control the program to avoid creating undue risk or encouraging excessive risk-tasking by executives; and
===========================================================[Key Aspects of 2022 Design] As part of the redesign and in connection with the new availability of equity compensation pursuant to the 2021 Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee reduced the annual cash incentive targets for each of our officers and incorporated long-term equity-based incentive compensation to more closely align with practices within the Reference Group. We believe that our program, including awards under the 2021 Incentive Plan, has an appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to our overall business strategy and that the balance of compensation elements discourages excessive risk-taking.
===========================================================[Compensation Philosophy and Approach] TPL’s 2022 executive compensation program was designed to recruit and retain an executive team and to reward performance in achieving TPL’s goals of protecting and maintaining the assets of TPL. The 2022 executive compensation program consisted principally of a salary, an annual cash bonus (sometimes referred to as awards under a non-equity incentive plan commencing in 2022), and share-based compensation. Base salaries provide our Named Executive Officers with a steady income stream that is not contingent on TPL’s performance. Differences in salary for the Named Executive Officers may reflect the differing responsibilities of their respective positions, the differing levels of experience of the individuals and internal pay-equity considerations. The cash bonus allows the Compensation Committee flexibility to recognize and reward the Named Executive Officers’ contributions to TPL’s performance in any given year. Salaries are reviewed annually, and salary adjustments and the amounts of cash bonuses are determined by the Compensation Committee and the Board, as applicable, based upon an evaluation of the Named Executive Officer’s performance and contributions, as well as overall performance of the Company, against the goals and objectives of TPL in accordance with the relevant employment agreements in effect, as applicable. Share-based compensation awards link pay to performance and aligns executive officers’ interests with those of the Company and its stockholders over the long term. See “Employment Agreements” below. In accordance with the employment agreements, final bonus amounts for a completed year are expected to be finalized during the first quarter of the following year.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] As part of its compensation program, TPL maintains both a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a qualified defined contribution plan which are both available to employees generally, as well as to the Named Executive Officers. These plans are designed to assist employees in planning for their retirement.
===========================================================[Consideration of 2022 Say on Pay Vote] At our November 2022 stockholder meeting, the majority of our stockholders voted to approve our executive compensation program, with approximately 71% approval among votes cast. The Compensation Committee viewed this as support of its approach and philosophy and as a basis for continuing with the program described in this CD&A for 2022.
===========================================================[Role of the Committee] The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to determine the compensation of the Named Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and to make recommendations to the Board, which has the authority to make final decisions, with respect to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer.  The Compensation Committee is also responsible for developing and overseeing an equity compensation program for the Company generally for other employees, and for making recommendations to the Board with respect to compensation for non-employee directors, with assistance from the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant.
===========================================================[Role of the Committee] In establishing the Named Executive Officers’ compensation for 2022, the Compensation Committee Chair and the full Compensation Committee met multiple times, including with management and/or the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant, to review market practices, evaluate potential alternatives, and determine appropriate metrics and goals.
===========================================================[Role of Management] Our CEO, Mr. Glover, provided recommendations for compensation for his direct reports. Additionally, the management team provided the Compensation Committee with financial performance information to assist with the assessment of company and individual performance in determining the bonuses for 2022. The Compensation Committee considered this information in its decision-making process.  No member of management participated in discussions relating to his or her own compensation.

===========================================================[Role of the Independent Consultant] In May 2021, after a competitive bid process pursuant to which several compensation consultants were considered, the Compensation Committee selected Meridian as its new independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation Committee in fulfilling its responsibilities related to the oversight of TPL Corporation’s executive officer and non-employee director compensation.  The Compensation Committee determined that Meridian was independent from management based upon the consideration of various relevant factors, including that Meridian did not provide any services to TPL except advisory services to the Compensation Committee, and that Meridian had and adhered to policies and procedures that were designed to prevent conflicts of interests.
===========================================================[Role of the Independent Consultant] The independent compensation consultant advises the Compensation Committee in the development of pay strategies regarding our executive officers, including our CEO, and non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee reviews and discusses matters involving executive officer and non-employee director compensation. Following this review, the Compensation Committee makes a determination and/or recommendation to the Board, as applicable under the Compensation Committee’s charter, regarding, among other things (a) the compensation of the CEO and the compensation of executive officers other than the CEO, in each case including salary, bonus, benefits, incentive awards and perquisites, and (b) compensation for TPL’s non-employee directors.
===========================================================[Determining the 2022 Compensation Program] As described below, the Compensation Committee asked Meridian to review market data as part of the process of  establishing 2022 compensation for our Named Executive Officers, which included transitioning to a more equity-based compensation program.  As part of this process, the Compensation Committee noted that TPL is a unique organization in a number of ways:
===========================================================[Table of Contents] It is the largest publicly-traded mineral royalty focused organization, with a market capitalization more than double the next largest publicly-traded mineral royalty focused organization;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Unlike most mineral royalty focused organizations, TPL also owns and manages a large amount of surface rights;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] These surface rights allow the creation of additional business lines, such as our Surface Leases, Easements and Material (referred to as “SLEM”) and water businesses;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] TPL’s legacy assets carry zero basis on the balance sheet; and
===========================================================[Table of Contents] TPL’s financial profile is unusual with no debt, limited book assets, and high margins.  TPL also returns a significant portion of its cash flow to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] As a result of these unique characteristics, TPL does not have any close peers.  Instead of reviewing peer group market data, the Compensation Committee asked Meridian to review compensation for a group of comparable reference companies (the “Reference Group”). The Reference Group (listed below) represents companies which operate in ancillary businesses such as royalty companies, midstream companies, E&P companies, and real estate investment trusts that have business lines similar to TPL and are similar in market capitalization, enterprise value, and/or Adjusted EBITDA.

===========================================================[Table of Contents] Market data from this Reference Group, plus additional broad survey data from general industry and the E&P industry, was used by the Compensation Committee as a reference to help determine the 2022 compensation program design and individual pay levels as well as in determining the 2022 compensation, which is described below. During 2022, in preparation for decisions regarding 2023 compensation, the Compensation Committee updated the components of the Reference Group to focus on the unique dynamics of the oil & gas industry by removing the Real Estate Investment Trust companies and adding additional Royalty, Midstream, and E&P Companies, including Sitio Royalties Corp (Royalty), Kimbell Royalty Partners (Royalty), Magellan Midstream Partners (Midstream), Equitrans Midstream Corporation (Midstream), Southwestern Energy (E&P), and Range Resources (E&P).
===========================================================[2022 Compensation Program] TPL’s 2022 executive compensation program was designed to reward performance in achieving TPL’s goals of protecting and maintaining the assets of TPL as detailed below.
===========================================================[Base Salaries] Our Named Executive Officers receive a base salary to provide a competitive level of fixed compensation based on each individual’s role, experience, qualifications, and individual performance.  The base salaries as of the end of 2022 for our Named Executive Officers were as follows:

===========================================================[2022 Annual Incentive Targets] As part of the compensation program redesign for 2022, the Compensation Committee reduced the annual cash incentive targets for each of our officers and established goals and metrics for the annual incentive cash bonus.  Each of the executive officers had a target bonus expressed as a percentage of salary established based on references to market data as described above.  The target bonuses as a percentage of salary for each of our Named Executive Officers for 2022 were as follows:

===========================================================[2022 Annual Incentive Targets] These were substantially reduced from their target bonus opportunity in 2021.
===========================================================[2022 Annual Incentive Targets] The Committee also established a more structured annual incentive program, with goals tied to key metrics for the company. For 2022, the metrics included two financial metrics (Adjusted EBITDA Margin % and Free Cash Flow/share (FCF/share)) as well as several strategic objectives, as outlined below.

===========================================================[Annual (Short-Term) Incentive Program Summary] TPL’s performance against the pre-established financial goals can be heavily influenced by the impact of changes in commodity prices. To mitigate this impact, the Committee implemented a commodity adjustment calculation, which uses a collar on commodity prices. Within the collar range, no adjustment is made for commodity prices. If commodity prices fall below or rise above the collar range, a floor or cap on prices is applied. This provides our management team with some
===========================================================[Table of Contents] exposure to commodity price, in line with our stockholders, but limits the exposure with significant changes in commodity prices. In 2022, the collar for commodity prices ranged from $42.37 per Boe to $56.95 per Boe. Actual realizations were $60.81 per Boe, so financial performance for purposes of calculating annual incentive results was capped assuming a $56.95 per Boe price for determining adjusted EBITDA margin and FCF per share.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Based on final financial results, TPL exceeded the Maximum level on both of the financial metrics, earning 200% of target on each of these metrics.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] The Compensation Committee also established strategic objectives for the year which were intended to encourage our management team to take action to improve TPL’s long-term opportunities for success, but which didn’t directly impact financial results in 2022.

===========================================================[Long-Term Incentive Program] As part of the program redesign of 2022, the Compensation Committee implemented a long-term incentive plan for key employees at TPL, including Named Executive Officers. The goals of the long-term incentive plan include:
===========================================================[Long-Term Incentive Program] Create a retention incentive through a substantial forfeitable balance with long-term vesting.
===========================================================[Long-Term Incentive Program] Provide a competitive compensation program aligned with typical company practices.
===========================================================[Land and Resource Management] Our Land and Resource Management segment encompasses the business of managing our approximately 874,000 surface acres of land and our oil and gas royalty interests in West Texas. The revenue streams of this segment consist primarily of oil and gas royalties, revenues from easements, commercial leases and renewables, and land and material sales.
===========================================================[Long-Term Incentive Program] To meet the objectives of the program, the Committee established a long-term incentive program for the Named Executive Officers that uses a combination of Performance Share Units (PSUs) and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). Each of the primary vehicles are summarized in the table below and described in more detail later in this section.

===========================================================[Performance Share Units (PSUs)] PSUs comprise 50% of our Named Executive Officers long-term incentive compensation. The PSUs create alignment between our executive officers and our long-term performance as measured by RTSR against a broad energy industry index (50% of PSUs) and the generation of Free Cash Flow per share over a 3 year period (50% of PSUs). These awards vest, if at all, at the end of a three year performance period.
===========================================================[Performance Share Units (PSUs)] The RTSR PSUs are intended to measure the performance of TPL’s stock against a broad set of energy industry companies included in the XOP index. Measuring RTSR against this group helps mitigate the impact of commodity price swings on the measurement of our performance. While TPL does not have any direct peers, the broad XOP index comprises many of our customers and other companies that are similarly-impacted by commodity prices.
===========================================================[Performance Share Units (PSUs)] The RTSR PSUs can be earned between 0% and 200% of the targeted number of shares based on our RTSR percentile ranking against the constituents of the XOP index as follows:
===========================================================[None] Indicate by check mark if the registrant is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act. Yes
===========================================================[Land and Resource Management] We are not an oil and gas producer. Rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our oil and gas royalty interests. Thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalties are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells.
===========================================================[The RTSR PSUs can be earned between 0% and 200% of the targeted number of shares based on our RTSR percentile ranking against the constituents of the XOP index as follows:] <table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Percentile Rank</td><td></td><td>Shares Earned as a % of Target (1)</td></tr><tr><td>90 th or above</td><td></td><td>200%</td></tr><tr><td>70

===========================================================[Performance Share Units (PSUs)] RTSR is measured using an average closing price at the beginning and end of the performance period. In the case of the 2022 awards, the average closing price of January 2025 will be compared against the average closing price during January 2022 with the addition of reinvested dividends from February 1, 2022 to January 31, 2025.
===========================================================[Performance Share Units (PSUs)] The FCF PSUs measure our cumulative FCF/share against our initial targets over a three-year period. If the Company is able to outperform and generate greater FCF, it will enable an increase in returns to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. By measuring FCF on a per share basis, it requires our management team to ensure any dilution to our stockholders results in sufficiently greater FCF on an absolute basis.
===========================================================[Performance Share Units (PSUs)] The FCF PSUs can be earned between 0% and 200% of the targeted number of shares based on cumulative FCF per share as follows:

===========================================================[Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)] RSUs comprise the other 50% of our Named Executive Officers’ long-term incentive compensation. Regular grants of RSUs are intended to help build an ownership stake in TPL, thereby aligning the executives with TPL stockholders. The RSUs serve as a retention tool by creating a substantial forfeitable stake in the Company. The RSUs vest based on continued service to TPL at a rate of 33%/year, beginning with the first anniversary of the grant date.
===========================================================[2022 Long-Term Incentive Grants] At the beginning of 2022, the Committee established target long-term incentive grant levels for each of its Named Executive Officers based on a review of market data from the reference group and consideration of other factors such as experience and expertise, individual and company performance, and potential competitive opportunities for each of our Named Executive Officers. The target long-term incentive grant levels were established as a percentage of salary and converted into a number of shares based on the stock price on the grant date of $1,105.45 per share (the closing price of our Common Stock on the date the awards were granted). The February 2022 awards are summarized in the table below:

===========================================================[2022 Long-Term Incentive Grants] The Target LTI Dollar Amount does not match the accounting values in the Summary Compensation Table as the accounting value of the  RTSR PSUs reflects a Monte Carlo valuation.
===========================================================[Other Compensation] TPL’s Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the same benefit programs as are available to all TPL employees generally.  These include both a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a qualified defined contribution plan. These plans are designed to assist employees in planning for their retirement.  There are no supplemental non-qualified programs solely for the benefit of our executives.
===========================================================[Other Compensation] TPL also provides certain executive officers with minimal perquisites, including an automobile allowance.
===========================================================[Stock Ownership Guidelines] The Company believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders for our Named Executive Officers and other executive officers to maintain a significant ownership position in TPL to create substantial alignment between our senior management and our stockholders. Therefore, we have established stock ownership guidelines applicable to all of our executive officers. The ownership guidelines require each of our executive officers to hold shares of Common Stock with an aggregate value of at least a specified multiple of base salary as follows:
===========================================================[Stock Ownership Guidelines] Shares counting towards the guideline include TPL shares held outright and unvested time-based restricted shares.  Performance shares do not count until earned.  Until each officer has achieved the desired ownership level, he or she is required to retain at least 50% of the after-tax shares received upon vesting of equity awards.
===========================================================[Employment Agreements] The Company has entered into employment agreements with each Named Executive Officer following approval from the Compensation Committee.  These employment agreements provide for minimum levels of compensation and provide severance protections for the officer upon a termination of employment without Cause or for Good Reason (as defined in the
===========================================================[Table of Contents] During 2022, we entered into agreements with third parties related to renewables and various “next generation” opportunities that will potentially utilize TPL’s surface assets.  These agreements include the evaluation of grid-connected batteries, studies on carbon capture and sequestration, and development of bitcoin mining facilities, among other opportunities.  Generally, these projects are structured with multi-year terms that allow for feasibility and/or commercial suitability and revenue arrangements that provide royalty, fee, profit sharing, lease and/or rental payments, though contractual terms and timing for commercial operations will vary by project.  We do not anticipate these agreements will have a significant impact on our revenues in the short-term but do have the potential to contribute meaningfully to our revenues in the longer term.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] agreements).  These agreements help match competitive practices and also include certain restrictive covenants which help protect the Company.  The provisions of these agreements are summarized under the “Employment Agreements” below.
===========================================================[Accounting and Tax Considerations] In setting the components of our executive compensation program, the Committee considers the impact of the following tax and accounting provisions:
===========================================================[Code Section 162(m).] Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) generally disallows a tax deduction by public companies for compensation over $1 million paid individually to covered employees, as defined in the Code. Tax deductibility is only one factor considered by the Committee in making compensation decisions that are in the best interest of TPL and our stockholders.
===========================================================[Code Section 162(m).] Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718, “Stock Compensation” (“ASC Topic 718”).
===========================================================[Code Section 162(m).] ASC Topic 718 requires a public company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity based on the grant date fair value of the award. Our equity awards to the Named Executives Officers (and to our other employees) are structured to maintain the appropriate accounting treatment.
===========================================================[Code Section 409A.] Section 409A of the Code provides that deferrals of compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or arrangement are to be included in an individual’s current gross income to the extent that such deferrals are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and have not previously been included in the individual’s gross income, unless certain requirements are met. We structure our stock plans, change of control agreements, severance plans and agreements and other incentive plans and agreements, each to the extent they are subject to Section 409A, to be in compliance with Section 409A.
===========================================================[Code Sections 280G and 4999.] The change of control benefits in our Named Executive Officers’ employment agreements provide that, upon a change of control, we will either (i) reduce the amount of severance benefits otherwise payable to the executive officer so that such severance benefits will not be subject to excise tax for purposes of Code Sections 280G and 4999 or (ii) pay the full amount of severance benefits to the executive officer (but with no tax “gross-up”), whichever produces the better after-tax result for the executive officer (often referred to as the “best-of-net” approach).
===========================================================[Risk Assessment] The Compensation Committee has reviewed the relationship between our risk management policies and compensation policies and practices and concluded that we do not have any compensation policies or practices that expose us to risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on TPL.
===========================================================[Other Compensation-Related Policies] We have an Insider Trading Policy that sets forth terms, conditions, timing, limitations, and prohibitions with respect to trading in the Company’s securities. The Insider Trading Policy also generally prohibits executive officers, among others, from hedging, including engaging in publicly-traded options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments relating to the Company’s securities, or selling the Company’s securities “short.” The Insider Trading Policy also requires that such persons obtain pre-approval from the Company’s General Counsel for all pledges, and the deposit in margin accounts, of the Company’s securities. The Insider Trading Policy is discussed further under “Insider Trading Policy; Anti-Hedging Policy” below.
===========================================================[Other Compensation-Related Policies] We have a Clawback Policy that requires covered executives to reimburse the Company, or forfeit, any excess incentive compensation received by them during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any such financial reporting requirement. The Clawback Policy is discussed further under “Matters Relating to Our Governance” above.

===========================================================[Pension Benefits] The Restated Texas Pacific Land Corporation Employees’ Pension Plan is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan qualified under Section 401 of the Code in which the employees participate. The remuneration covered by the Plan is Salary. The Plan provides a normal retirement benefit equal to 1.5% of a participant’s average Salary for the last five years prior to retirement for each year of Credited Service under the Plan. Credited Service is earned from the participant’s date of membership in the Plan, which is generally not the participant’s date of hire by the Company. For information concerning the valuation method and material assumptions used in quantifying the present value of the Named Executive Officers’ current accrued benefits, see Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” of the Notes to Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Report.
===========================================================[Pension Benefits] As of December 31, 2022, the annual accrued normal retirement benefits are estimated to be $43,050 for Mr. Glover, $11,000 for Mr. Steddum, and $4,463 for Mr. Dobbs.
===========================================================[Pension Benefits] The Plan provides for early retirement after 20 years of service with the Company. Early retirement benefits are calculated in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit, but are reduced by 1/15 for each of the first five years and 1/30 for each of the next five years that benefits commence prior to normal retirement. If benefits commence more than 10 years prior to normal retirement, the early retirement benefit payable at age 55 is reduced actuarially for the period prior to age 55. None of the listed participants are currently eligible for early retirement benefits.
===========================================================[Pay Ratio Disclosure] For purposes of calculating the 2022 ratio of the median annual total compensation of all employees to the total annual compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, TPL included base salary, annual bonus amounts, equity compensation, if any, and all other amounts deemed compensation in its calculation of annual total compensation.  We used December 31, 2022 as the measurement date.  Base salary amounts were annualized for any employee who had less than a full year of service during 2022. Total compensation for Mr. Glover, the Chief Executive Officer, was determined to be $6,285,419 and was approximately 38 times the median annual compensation of all of our employees, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, of $164,123.  For purposes of this calculation, the Company had 98 employees, excluding the Chief Executive Officer.
===========================================================[Mr. Glover] On August 8, 2019, the Trust entered into an employment agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) with Mr. Glover, its General Agent and Chief Executive Officer (the “Glover Agreement”). The Employment Agreement was effective as of July 1, 2019.
===========================================================[Mr. Glover] In connection with the Corporate Reorganization, the Company entered into an amended and restated agreement with  Mr. Glover, described below.
===========================================================[Mr. Glover] Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Glover received a base salary of $800,000 per annum, subject to annual review, and was eligible for an annual cash bonus of up to 300% of such base salary for achievement of specified performance targets, except that the cash bonus for the calendar year 2019 was at least 100% of the cash bonus paid with respect to 2018, as established by the Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Trust. Until the Trust or the Company established an equity compensation plan, Mr. Glover was required to use at least 25% of his cash bonus (net of estimated taxes) to purchase Sub-shares or Common Stock. The term of the Glover Agreement ended on December 31, 2020, with automatic one (1) year extensions unless notice not to renew was given at least 120 days prior to the relevant end date.
===========================================================[Mr. Glover] The Glover Agreement provided for payment of severance benefits if Mr. Glover’s employment was terminated by the Trust without cause or by the officer for good reason, provided that the officer executes a general waiver and release of claims
===========================================================[Table of Contents] and complies with the restrictive covenants described below. The severance benefits included (i) accrued but unpaid bonuses and vested long-term incentive benefits (ii) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination (if such termination occurs after the first calendar quarter), (iii) up to 18 months of COBRA premiums for continued group health, dental and vision coverage for the officer and his dependents, paid for by the Trust, and (iv) if such termination occurred during the first 15 months of the term, an amount equal to two times the average of his base salary and cash bonus for the preceding two years, which amount would be reduced to one times such average for the preceding year if such termination occurred after the first 15 months of the term. If the officer’s employment was terminated by the Trust without cause, by the officer for good reason, or upon failure of the Trust to renew the term of the Agreement, in all such cases, within 24 months following a change in control of the Trust as defined in the Agreements, then, in lieu of the amount specified in clause (iv), the officer was entitled to an amount equal to 2.99 times the greater of (a) the average of his base salary and cash bonus for the two years preceding the change in control and (b) his base salary and target cash bonus for the year of the change in control.

The officer would also be entitled to payment of accrued but unpaid salary, accrued but unused vacation, unsubsidized COBRA benefits, and unreimbursed business expenses following termination of employment for any reason.

===========================================================[Table of Contents] (1)    From time to time, the Board constitutes ad hoc committees and determines whether any, and if so how much, compensation is paid for such service. Any such payments made to directors during the year ended December 31, 2022 are reflected in the “Fees Earned or Paid in Cash” column of the table above.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] (4)    Mr. McGinnis resigned the Board effective March 28, 2022.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] On an annual basis, all non-employee directors receive a base retainer of $210,000, of which half is paid in cash and half is paid in shares of Common Stock unless otherwise determined by the Company, valued at the closing price of the Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant of January 1 of each year, and vesting on the first anniversary of grant. Commencing January 1, 2023, the stock portion of the annual retainer fee was increased to $125,000 (and the cash portion remained at $105,000). In addition, non-employee directors receive the following amounts for additional Board and committee service: $40,000 for Board co-chair, $10,000 for committee service (per committee), $10,000 for Audit Committee chair, $5,000 for Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair, and $5,000 for Compensation Committee Chair. Commencing January 1, 2023, the additional amount for Board co-chair service was increased to $50,000. Directors serving in multiple leadership roles receive incremental compensation for each role, including that committee chairs receive both the committee service fee plus the specified amount for chairing such committee. Directors are not expected to receive additional compensation for attending regularly scheduled Board or committee meetings. For less than full years of service, the compensation paid to the non-employee directors will be prorated based on the number of days of service.
===========================================================[Oil and Gas Activity for the Year Ended December 31, 2022] For the year ended December 31, 2022, the number of oil and gas wells that have been drilled but are not yet completed (“DUC”) subject to our royalty interest was 584 compared to 452 for the same period of 2021.  The number of DUC wells is determined using uniform drilling spacing units with pooled interests for all wells awaiting completion.
===========================================================[Stock Ownership Guidelines] The Company believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders for our directors to maintain a significant ownership position in TPL to create substantial alignment with our stockholders. Therefore, we have established stock ownership guidelines applicable to our non-employee directors. The ownership guidelines require each of our non-employee directors to acquire, within five (5) years, and hold shares of Common Stock with an aggregate value of at least five (5) times the base cash retainer. Shares counting towards the guidelines include TPL shares held outright and unvested time-based restricted shares. However, non-employee directors are permitted to sell shares of Common Stock to facilitate tax obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted shares. If a non-employee director falls below the applicable multiple due solely to a decline in the value of shares of Common Stock, such non-employee director will not be required to acquire additional shares to meet the applicable multiple.
===========================================================[Participation] Prior to our Corporate Reorganization effective January 11, 2021, each of the Trustees was a member of the Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Trustees.

The 2021 Plan was approved by our Board on August 11, 2021 and by our stockholders on December 29, 2021, and will expire on December 29, 2031. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan is 75,000 shares, which may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares (if any), treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner.
===========================================================[2021 Incentive Plan] Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement or otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, upon a Change in Control of the Company the following shall occur:
===========================================================[2021 Incentive Plan] For awards other than performance awards, a Replacement Award (that is, an award with a value and terms that are at least as favorable as the outstanding award) may be issued;
===========================================================[2021 Incentive Plan] For awards other than performance awards, if a Replacement Award is not issued and the Company’s Common Stock ceases to be publicly traded after the change in control, such awards shall be immediately vested and exercisable upon such change in control;
===========================================================[2021 Incentive Plan] For unearned performance awards, the award shall be (i) earned on a pro-rata basis at the higher of actual or target performance and (ii) measured as of the end of the calendar quarter before the change in control date or, if the award is stock-price based, as of the effective date of the change in control;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] For earned but unvested performance awards, the award shall be immediately vested and payable as of the change in control;
===========================================================[Table of Contents] For awards other than performance awards, if the Company’s Common Stock continues to be publicly traded after change in control, such awards shall continue under their applicable terms, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Notwithstanding the forgoing, in the case of awards other than performance awards, the Compensation Committee may cancel such awards, and the award holders shall receive shares or cash equal to the difference between the amount stockholders receive for their shares and the purchase price per share, if any, under the award. Except as may be provided in a severance compensation agreement between the Company and the Participant, if, in connection with a change in control, a Participant’s payment of any awards will cause the Participant to be liable for federal excise tax levied on certain “excess parachute payments,” then either (i) all payments otherwise due; or (ii) the reduced payment amount to avoid an excess parachute payment, whichever will provide the Participant with the greater after- tax economic benefit taking into account any applicable excise tax, shall be paid to the Participant. In no event will any Participant be entitled to receive any kind of gross-up payment or reimbursement for any excise taxes payable in connection with change in control payments.
===========================================================[2021 Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan] We maintain our 2021 Non-Employee Director and Deferred Compensation Plan (the “2021 Director Plan”), pursuant to which we may grant shares of Common Stock to each of our non-employee directors and our non-employee directors may defer some or all of their directors’ cash fees and stock compensation. The 2021 Director Plan was approved by our Board on August 11, 2021 and by our stockholders on December 29, 2021, and will expire on December 29, 2031. The maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the 2021 Director Plan is 10,000 shares, which may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares (if any), treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner.

===========================================================[2021 Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan] Unless otherwise determined by the administrator of the 2021 Director Plan in connection with a grant, a change in control shall have the following effects on outstanding awards:
===========================================================[2021 Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan] On a change in control in which a Director receives a replacement award with a value and terms that are at least as favorable as the Director’s outstanding awards (a “Replacement Award”), the Director’s outstanding awards shall remain outstanding subject to the terms of the Replacement Award.
===========================================================[2021 Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan] On a change in control in which the Company’s shares cease to be publicly traded, the Director’s outstanding awards shall become immediately vested unless the Director receives Replacement Awards.
===========================================================[2021 Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan] On a change in control in which the Company’s shares continue to be publicly traded, a Director’s outstanding awards shall remain outstanding and be treated as Replacement Awards.
===========================================================[2021 Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan] Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator of the 2021 Director Plan may determine that any or all outstanding awards granted under the 2021 Director Plan will be canceled and terminated upon a change in control, and that in connection with such cancellation and termination, the Director shall receive for each share of Common Stock subject to such award a cash payment (or the delivery of shares of stock, other securities or a combination of cash, stock and securities equivalent to such cash payment) equal to the consideration received by stockholders of the Company for a share of Common Stock in such change in control.

===========================================================[Opinion on the Financial Statements] We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Texas Pacific Land Corporation (the “Company” as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
===========================================================[Opinion on the Financial Statements] We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in
===========================================================[Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)] issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
===========================================================[Basis for Opinion] These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
===========================================================[Basis for Opinion] We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
===========================================================[Critical Audit Matter] The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
===========================================================[Critical Audit Matter] Accrual of Oil and Gas Royalties — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements
===========================================================[Critical Audit Matter Description] The Company records an accrual for oil and gas royalty revenues not received during the month for oil and gas removed from the respective mineral reserve locations. As of December 31, 2022, this oil and gas royalty accrual approximated $50.1 million, and is included in accounts receivable and accrued receivables, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the production of oil and gas and the receipt of the actual payment by operators, which is typically one to two months after the production of oil and gas. The determination of the oil and gas royalty accrual involves an analysis of historical production volumes, estimates of the timing of future payments, and recent market prices for oil and gas. The realized transaction prices for oil and gas royalty revenues are subject to national and international economic and political considerations and locational and contractual basis differences.
===========================================================[Critical Audit Matter Description] Given the significant judgment in determining future estimated payments based on estimated production volumes, payment timing, and realized prices for oil and gas products made by the Company, performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company’s estimate of accrued oil and gas royalties required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating audit evidence and an increased extent of effort.

===========================================================[How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit] Our audit procedures related to the Company’s accrual of oil and gas royalties included the following, among others:
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related the Company’s estimate of the accrual of revenues from oil and gas royalties
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We evaluated the method used by management to develop the estimate considering historical production, payments, and timing of payments
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We evaluated the Company’s estimation process by performing a retrospective review of variances between accrued revenue estimates and subsequent receipts of payments of oil and gas royalties
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We tested the completeness and accuracy of historical production and payment data used in the estimating payments not yet received for production during the current period, and assessed the relevance of historical data to the current period estimate
===========================================================[Table of Contents] We assessed the estimate of realized prices for oil and gas royalties used in the accrual of oil and gas royalties based on market pricing data and historical price differentials
===========================================================[Opinion on the Financial Statements] We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows of Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”), known since January 11, 2021 as Texas Pacific Land Corporation, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the results of the Trust’s operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
===========================================================[Basis for Opinion] These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust’s financial statements based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the United States federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
===========================================================[Basis for Opinion] We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
===========================================================[Basis for Opinion] Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

===========================================================[Table of Contents] While 51.8% of our revenue comes from only four customers, these customers are in the top 25 energy companies in the world based on market cap, with two being in the top 10, and we believe each of them is a strong and reliable operator.  Given their major presence in the Permian Basin and our significant surface lands in the same area, the high concentration of business with these four customers is expected.  Further, the choice of whom we do business with largely depends on location of mineral royalties and surface rights on or near our assets and consists of a limited universe of oil and gas companies who operate in the Permian Basin.

===========================================================[Seasonality] While the business of TPL is not seasonal in nature, as that term is generally understood, revenues from oil and gas royalties may fluctuate from period to period based upon market prices for oil and gas and production decisions made by the operators. Our other revenue streams, which include, but are not limited to, water sales and royalties, easements and other surface related income and sales of land, may also fluctuate from period to period. In addition, our results generally rely on the decisions and actions of third parties out of our ultimate control.

===========================================================[1.    Organization and Description of Business Segments] Texas Pacific Land Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as “TPL”, the “Company”, “our”, “we” or “us”) is a Delaware corporation and one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately 874,000 surface acres of land in West Texas, with the majority of our ownership concentrated in the Permian Basin.  Additionally, we own a 1/128th nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest (“NPRI”) under approximately 85,000 acres of land, a 1/16th NPRI under approximately 371,000 acres of land, and approximately 4,000 additional net royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th) in the western part of Texas.
===========================================================[1.    Organization and Description of Business Segments] TPL’s income is derived primarily from oil, gas and produced water royalties, sales of water and land, easements and commercial leases of the land.
===========================================================[1.    Organization and Description of Business Segments] On January 11, 2021, we completed our reorganization from a business trust, organized under a Declaration of Trust dated February 1, 1888 (the “Declaration of Trust”), to a corporation (the “Corporate Reorganization”) and changed our name from Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”) to Texas Pacific Land Corporation.  See further discussion of the Corporate Reorganization and its impact on our equity structure in Note 11, “Equity.”  Any references in these consolidated financial statements and notes to the Company, TPL, our, we, or us with respect to periods prior to January 11, 2021 are in reference to the Trust, and references to periods on or after that date are in reference to Texas Pacific Land Corporation or TPL Corporation.
===========================================================[1.    Organization and Description of Business Segments] We operate our business in two segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations.  Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses.  The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives of TPL and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.  See Note 12, “Business Segment Reporting” for further information regarding our segments.
===========================================================[Basis of Presentation] The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include our consolidated accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
===========================================================[No] Indicate by check mark whether the registrant is a large accelerated filer, an accelerated filer, a non-accelerated filer, or a smaller reporting company. See the definitions of “large accelerated filer,” “accelerated filer,” “smaller reporting company” and “emerging growth company” in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. (Check One)
===========================================================[Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)] Integrating sustainability and ESG objectives is a priority for our Company.  Our ESG strategy is focused on the overarching priorities of environmental management, employee health and safety, workforce management and equality, community and landowner engagement, and strong corporate governance and ethics.  We are committed to sustainability and responsible stewardship across all of our operations and land management activities.
===========================================================[Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements] The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  In the event estimates and/or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
===========================================================[Royalties] Oil and gas royalties are received in connection with royalty interests owned by TPL. Oil and gas royalties are reported net of production taxes and are recognized as revenue when crude oil and gas products are removed from the respective mineral reserve locations. Oil and gas royalty payments are generally received one to two months after the crude oil and gas products are removed. An accrual for amounts not received during the month removed is included in accounts receivable and accrued receivables, net based on historical trends.
===========================================================[Royalties] The oil and gas royalties which we receive are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas, and locational and contractual price differences. The market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political conditions and subject to significant price fluctuations.
===========================================================[Royalties] TPL has analyzed public reports of drilling activities by the oil companies operating where we have an oil and gas royalty interest in an effort to identify unpaid royalties associated with royalty interests we own. Rights to certain oil and gas
===========================================================[Table of Contents] royalties we believe to be due and payable may be subject to dispute with the oil company involved as a result of disagreements with respect to drilling and related engineering information. Disputed oil and gas royalties are recorded when these contingencies are resolved.
===========================================================[Other Surface-Related Income] Easement contracts represent contracts which permit companies to install pipelines, electric lines and other equipment on land owned by TPL. When TPL receives a signed contract and payment, we make available the respective parcel of land to the grantee.  Easement income is recognized upon the execution of the easement agreement, or in the event of a renewal upon receipt of the renewal payment, as at that point in time, we have satisfied our performance obligation and the customer has right of use.
===========================================================[Other Surface-Related Income] Leases of our surface acreage include, but are not limited to, facility, roadway and surface leases with a typical lease term of ten years and generally require fixed annual payments.  Lease cancellations are allowed under certain circumstances, but initial lease deposits are generally nonrefundable.  The initial lease deposits and annual payments are recorded as unearned revenue upon receipt and amortized over the life of the lease.  Advance lease payments are deferred and amortized over the appropriate accounting period.
===========================================================[Other Surface-Related Income] Other surface-related income includes revenue from permits, material sales, and renewable energy sources.  Revenue from permits is recognized upon execution of the contract and receipt of payment.  Revenue from material sales is recognized upon the removal of materials by the customer.  Revenue from renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, generally consist of leases, some of which may include a provision for future royalties once certain circumstances occur. As discussed above, lease payments are recorded as unearned revenue and amortized over the life of the lease. Royalties are recognized based upon actual production.
===========================================================[Sales] Water sales revenue encompasses sales of water to operators and other customers, royalties received related to areas of mutual interest (“AMI”), and royalties received pursuant to legacy agreements with operators.  In certain instances, we enter into agreements with third parties to provide various water services, including but not limited to, the purchase, sale or transfer of water within a specific geographic area, also known as an AMI. Our performance obligation is deemed satisfied upon the delivery of water at which point, revenue is recognized. In instances where a third party other than the customer is involved in the sale and/or transport of water, such as a revenue share agreement, brokered water sale transaction or third party acquisition of water, the Company will either be acting as the principal or the agent in the water sales transaction.  If the Company is deemed to be acting as a principal, the associated revenues are reported on a gross basis in water sales revenue and the corresponding costs associated with the sale are reported as an operating expense in water service-related expenses in the consolidated income statement.  If the Company is deemed to be acting as an agent, principally in brokered water transactions, the associated water sales revenue is reported net of the corresponding costs associated with the sale and included in the water sales revenue line item on the consolidated income statement.
===========================================================[Sales] We include all costs associated with water sales including purchases of water from third parties, transfer costs and treatment expenses in water service-related expenses.
===========================================================[Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)] As the Company does not produce oil or gas from the land from which its royalties’ revenue stream is derived, it developed its sustainability goals and partnership opportunities in consultation with the entities operating on its land. On the water solutions side of its business, the Company developed a tailored ESG program that addresses the ethical and responsible buildout of water assets and management of water as a natural resource. The Company’s continued goal is an integrated and iterative approach to sustainable and responsible resource management.
===========================================================[Produced Water Royalties] Produced water royalties represents revenue from the transfer and disposal of saltwater from producing oil and gas wells on our land.  Revenue is recognized when the water is transported across or injected into our land.
===========================================================[Sales and Exchanges] We consider purchasers of land to be our customers as land management, leasing and sales are normal operating activities for TPL.  Revenue is recognized on land sales when the performance obligation to the purchaser (customer) is complete.  Revenue from land exchanges is recognized based upon the estimated fair value of the consideration exchanged.
===========================================================[Equivalents and Restricted Cash] We consider investments in bank deposits, money market funds, and highly-liquid cash investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents
===========================================================[Table of Contents] and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):

===========================================================[Receivables] Receivables consist primarily of trade accounts receivable related to water and material sales and royalty income due related to our oil, gas and produced water royalties. An allowance is recorded for expected credit losses and is based upon our historical write-off experience, aging of trade accounts receivable and collectibility patterns of our customers. The allowance for expected credit loss was approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
===========================================================[Accrual of Oil and Gas Royalties] The Company accrues oil and gas royalties, which are included in accounts receivable and accrued receivables, net. An accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the production of oil and gas and generation of the actual payment by operators. The oil and gas royalty accrual is based upon historical production volumes, estimates of the timing of future payments and recent market prices for oil and gas.
===========================================================[Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)] TPL’s ESG accomplishments and goals include but are not limited to:
===========================================================[Accrual of Oil and Gas Royalties] Accrued oil and gas royalties included in accounts receivable and accrued receivables, net totaled $50.1 million and $49.9 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
===========================================================[Real Estate Acquired] Real estate acquired is recorded at cost and carried at the lower of cost or market. Valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments, if any, are recorded by a charge to net income and a valuation allowance if the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value. Minimal real estate improvements are made to land. No impairments were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
===========================================================[Property, Plant and Equipment] Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with our development of infrastructure for sourcing and treating water are capitalized. We account for depreciation of property, plant and equipment on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Depreciable lives by category are as follows:

===========================================================[Royalty Interests Acquired] We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our royalty interests acquired, which are carried at the lower of cost or market. Valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Impairments, if any, are recorded by a charge to net income and a reduction in the carrying value of our royalty interests if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. No impairments were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
===========================================================[Royalty Interests Acquired] Depletion is recorded based upon a units of production basis.  Depletion expense was approximately $1.0 million, $1.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
===========================================================[Real Estate and Royalty Interests Assigned Through the 1888 Declaration of Trust] The fair market value of the land and royalty interests that were assigned through the 1888 Declaration of Trust, (referred to as “Assigned”) land and royalty interests, was not determined in 1888 when the Trust was formed; therefore, no value is assigned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to the Assigned land and royalty interests.  Consequently, in the consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income, no allowance is made for depletion and no cost is deducted from the proceeds of sales of the Assigned land and royalty interests.  Even though the 1888 value of real properties cannot be precisely determined, it has been concluded that the effect of this matter can no longer be significant to our financial position or results of operations. Minimal real estate improvements are made to land.
===========================================================[Leases] We lease certain facilities under operating leases. A determination of whether a contract contains a lease is made at the inception of the arrangement. Our leased facilities include our administrative offices located in Dallas and Midland, Texas, as well as some modular buildings in our West Texas yards.
===========================================================[Leases] Our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. We reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. Therefore, substantially all of the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.
===========================================================[Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)] Converted from a business trust to a Delaware corporation in January 2021, providing enhanced governance to the Company’s stockholders.
===========================================================[Leases] The lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. The interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.
===========================================================[Leases] For real estate leases, we account for lease components and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Certain leases contain fixed lease payments for items such as common area maintenance and parking. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. See Note 10, “Commitments” for additional information.
===========================================================[Income Taxes] Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
===========================================================[Income Taxes] When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.  The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.  Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority.  The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.  The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is zero as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.  We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income.
===========================================================[Share-Based Compensation] The Company utilizes the closing stock price on the date of grant to determine the fair value of service-vesting awards, which for the Company includes restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance stock units (“PSUs”) with a performance condition.  For PSUs with a market condition, grant date fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  Unvested awards are entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents which are accrued and distributed to award recipients at the time such awards vest.  Dividends are forfeitable if the related award is forfeited.  For RSAs, RSUs and PSUs with performance conditions, forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur.  For PSU awards with market conditions, forfeitures are only recognized if the award recipient does not render the required service during the measurement period.
===========================================================[Share-Based Compensation] Share-based compensation expense for RSUs and RSAs is recognized in the financial statements over the awards’ vesting periods using the graded-vesting method. Share-based compensation expense for PSU awards with performance conditions is recognized ratably over the measurement period at such time as the awards are probable and estimable. Share-based compensation expense for PSU awards with market conditions is recognized ratably over the measurement period whether the market condition is satisfied or not if the service for the award is rendered.  Share-based compensation is reported on the consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income as a component of salaries and related employee expenses for employee awards and in general and administrative expenses for director awards.
===========================================================[Income Per Share] Basic income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus unvested  shares issued pursuant to our equity and deferred compensation plans. See Note 9, “Earnings Per Share.”
===========================================================[Income Per Share] Prior to the Corporate Reorganization, shares outstanding were sub-share certificates (“Sub-shares”), par value of $0.03-1/3, and thereafter, shares outstanding are common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”).
===========================================================[Treasury Stock] Treasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired Common Stock is recorded as treasury stock. The cost associated with issuance of treasury stock is based on the average cost of treasury stock as of the date of issuance.
===========================================================[Comprehensive Income (Loss)] Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting capital that, under GAAP, are excluded from net income.
===========================================================[Table of Contents] Increased the electrification of the Company’s water assets in an effort to reduce costs and mitigate the overall emission profile of the Company by reducing reliance on diesel generators. TPL spent a total of $13.3 million of capital in 2022 and 2021 on electric infrastructure.
===========================================================[Concentrations of Credit Risk] We invest our cash and cash equivalents (which include U.S. Treasury bills, money market funds, and commercial paper with maturities of three months or less) among three major financial institutions in an attempt to minimize exposure to risk from any one of these entities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents deposited in our financial institutions in excess of federally-insured levels. We regularly monitor the financial condition of these financial institutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
===========================================================[Significant Customers] Four customers represented, in the aggregate, 51.8% of TPL’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. Three customers represented, in the aggregate 41.0% of TPL’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.  Two customers represented, in the aggregate, 28.3% of TPL’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
===========================================================[Reclassifications] Certain financial information on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been revised to conform to the current year presentation. These revisions include reclassifications of $101,000 of ad valorem taxes payable previously included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and
===========================================================[Table of Contents] $10,000 of changes in ad valorem taxes payable previously included in changes in operating liabilities, excluding income taxes, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.
===========================================================[Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance] In July 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-05, “
===========================================================[Leases (Topic 842) Lessors – Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments] .”  Under the ASU, a lessor classifies a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease at lease commencement if the lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or direct financing lease under ASC 842 classification criteria and the lessor would have otherwise recognized a day one loss.  The adoption of this guidance, effective January 1, 2022, had no impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Real estate acquired includes land parcels which have either been acquired through foreclosure or transactions with third parties.
===========================================================[Land Sales] For the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold 6,392 acres of land in Texas for an aggregate sales price of $9.7 million, an average of approximately $1,515 per acre.
===========================================================[Land Sales] For the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 30 acres of land in Texas for an aggregate sales price of approximately $0.7 million, an average of approximately $25,000 per acre.
===========================================================[Land Sales] For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 22,160 acres of land in Texas for an aggregate sales price of approximately $16.0 million, an average of approximately $721 per acre.

Such notes are backstopped by our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our senior secured hedged inventory facility; as such, any borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the available capacity under these facilities.,  [Index to Financial Statements] While we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe to be reasonable and prudent, we can provide no assurance that our current levels of insurance will be sufficient to cover any losses that we have incurred or may incur in the future, whether due to deductibles, coverage challenges or other limitations. In addition, over the last several years, as the scale and scope of our business activities has expanded, the breadth and depth of available insurance markets has contracted. As a result of these factors and other market conditions, as well as the fact that we have experienced several incidents in the past, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies have increased substantially. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates or on other terms we consider commercially reasonable. In addition, although we believe that we currently maintain adequate insurance coverage, insurance will not cover many types of interruptions or events that might occur and will not cover all risks associated with our operations. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur. The occurrence of a significant event, the consequences of which are either not covered by insurance or not fully insured, or a significant delay in, or denial of, the payment of a major insurance claim, could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For a discussion of our Line 901 Incident insurance receivable, please read Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates— Line 901 Incident Insurance Receivable” and Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.,  [Index to Financial Statements] We may also suffer damage (including reputational damage) as a result of a disaster, accident, catastrophe, terrorist attack or other such event. The occurrence of such an event, or a series of such events, especially if one or more of them occurs in a highly populated or sensitive area, could negatively impact public perception of our operations and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain the approvals, permits, licenses or real property interests we need in order to operate our assets or complete planned growth projects or other transactions.,  [Index to Financial Statements] Our general partner manages and operates the Partnership. If unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they currently have little practical ability to remove our general partner. Our general partner may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least 66,  [NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS] Additionally, we have elected practical expedients to exclude contracts with terms of one year or less, and therefore exclude the presentation of remaining performance obligations for short-term transportation, storage and processing services, merchant arrangements, including the non-cancelable period of evergreen arrangements, and any other types of arrangements with terms of one year or less.,  [Risks Related to Our Business] an inability to fully implement or realize expected returns or other anticipated benefits associated with joint venture and joint ownership arrangements, acquisitions, divestitures and other projects;,  [Consolidated Results] **   \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Indicates that variance as a percentage is not meaningful.,  [Index to Financial Statements] As these projects are undertaken, required approvals, permits and licenses may not be obtained, may be delayed, may be obtained with conditions that materially alter the expected return associated with the underlying projects or may be granted and then subsequently withdrawn;,  [Index to Financial Statements] We may enter into new businesses in connection with our strategy to participate in emerging energy opportunities. If we are unable to execute on this strategy or operate these new lines of business effectively, our future growth could be limited.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.,  [, Siri] For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.,  [Digital Content] that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.,  [Intellectual Property] The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services.

Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.,  [Digital Content] The Company operates various platforms, including the App Store'}
