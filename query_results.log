Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.

/////////////////////////////////////// Question: what are the risks
 CC0 ===============  [GENERAL RISKS] We may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems.
 CC1 ===============  [RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY] Risks associated with international operations could result in additional costs and inefficiencies.
 CC2 ===============  [GENERAL RISKS] Risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.
 CC3 ===============  [GENERAL RISKS] We are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 CC4 ===============  [RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY] Failure to protect our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 CC5 ===============  [RISK RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY] In addition, our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel require substantial investments, such as replacing systems, maintaining or enhancing systems or designing or acquiring new systems. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, incurring more costs than expected or implementation delays or errors, and may result in operational challenges, security control failures, reputational harm, and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 CC6 ===============  [RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY] The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 CC7 ===============  [GENERAL RISKS] Litigation, governmental proceedings, environmental, employment and tax legislation and regulations may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 CC8 ===============  [RISK RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY] Damage, failure or interruptions of information technology systems could adversely affect our business operations and results.
 CC9 ===============  [RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY] In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities. Furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may worsen. If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions, the cause of which could include a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
 CC10 ===============  [RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY] A change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, the limited supply or unavailability of key products, supply chain disruptions or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health.
 CC11 ===============  [Item 1A. Risk Factors] Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.
 CC12 ===============  [RISK RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY] A breach of customer, supplier, Team Member or Company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or litigation.

/////////////////////////////////////// Question: how is the management rewarded
 CC0 ===============  [Compensation, Benefits and Recognition:] Just as pay, benefits, and growth opportunities are critically important to our Team Members’ success, we believe it is equally important to recognize Team Members for a job well done. We regularly present many awards that range from recognizing individual service longevity to performance, allowing peer-to-peer recognition or management nomination of an individual’s excellent performance.
 CC1 ===============  [Compensation, Benefits and Recognition:] Our compensation philosophy has always been to incentivize Team Members to “run it like you own it,” and we continually evaluate and benchmark our comprehensive compensation programs to ensure they remain competitive, providing an important tool to attract and retain the best and most qualified Team Members in every market. We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through various incentive compensation programs. Store team members have the opportunity to earn incentive pay that increases their base hourly wage consistent with their individual performance or the performance of their store. Store managers, district managers, region directors and division vice presidents have the ability to earn additional compensation above their salary or base hourly wage based upon the performance of their stores. In addition, beginning with the district manager level, we augment our competitive programs with share-based compensation. We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our Team Members.
 CC2 ===============  [Talent Acquisition, Retention and Training:] Our Company knows the value of a tenured Team, which is why our philosophy is to “promote from within” first. As management opportunities arise, we look first within the Company and promote those who have performed well, have the right expertise and have shown leadership potential before looking outside the Company; however, we augment this philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, customer service excellence, subject matter expertise, and strong culture fit. This comprehensive approach increases Team Member commitment and has resulted in a very experienced leadership Team. As of December 31, 2022, our strong management Team was comprised of 226 senior managers who average 20 years of service, 293 corporate managers who average 16 years of service and 591 district managers who average 14 years of service.
 CC3 ===============  [GENERAL RISKS] In order to be successful, we will need to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees.
 CC4 ===============  [Team Members and Human Capital Management] Our tradition for 66 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “Live Green” culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member’s contribution to the success of O’Reilly. This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading Team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent.
 CC5 ===============  [Team Members and Human Capital Management] We are committed to providing a work environment that allows Team Members to feel highly valued and to be productive and effective in their jobs by maintaining an inclusive environment and healthy work/life balance, which we believe increases employee engagement. Our ongoing emphasis on diversity and inclusion, including our policies, recruitment and selection procedures, onboarding processes and training efforts, positively builds upon our successful “promote from within” philosophy and growth strategies.
 CC6 ===============  [Stock options:] The Company’s incentive plans provide for the awarding of shares of restricted stock to the non-employee directors of the Company that vest after one-year or evenly over a three-year period and are held in escrow until such vesting has occurred. Unvested shares are forfeited when a director ceases their service on the Company’s Board of Directors for reasons other than death or retirement. The fair value of shares awarded under these plans is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of award, and compensation expense is recorded evenly over the minimum required service period.
 CC7 ===============  [Profit sharing and savings plan:] The Company sponsors a contributory profit sharing and savings plan (the “401(k) Plan”) that covers substantially all employees who are at least 21 years of age and have completed one year of service. The Company makes matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 2% of each employee’s wages that are contributed and 25% of the next 4% of each employee’s wages that are contributed. An employee generally must be employed on December 31 to receive that year’s Company matching contribution, with the matching contribution funded annually at the beginning of the subsequent year following the year in which the matching contribution was earned. The Company may also make additional discretionary profit sharing contributions to the plan on an annual basis as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company did not make any discretionary contributions to the 401(k) Plan during the years ended

 CC9 ===============  [Stock options:] The Company’s incentive plans provide for the awarding of shares of restricted stock to certain key employees that vest evenly over a three-year period and are held in escrow until such vesting has occurred. Generally, unvested shares are forfeited when an employee ceases employment. The fair value of shares awarded under these plans is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of award and compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period or minimum required service period.
 CC10 ===============  [Stock options:] The Company’s incentive plans provide for the granting of stock options for the purchase of common stock of the Company to certain key employees of the Company. Employee stock options are granted at an exercise price that is equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. Employee stock options granted under the plans expire after 10 years and typically vest 25% per year, over four years. The Company records compensation expense for the grant date fair value of the option awards evenly over the vesting period or minimum required service period.
 CC11 ===============  [Experienced Management Team:] Our Company philosophy is to “promote from within,” and the vast majority of our senior managers, district managers and store managers have been promoted from within the Company. We augment this promote from within philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, technical proficiency or subject matter expertise. We have a strong management Team that has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 30 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993.

This comprehensive approach increases Team Member commitment and has resulted in a very experienced leadership Team. As of December 31, 2022, our strong management Team was comprised of 226 senior managers who average 20 years of service, 293 corporate managers who average 16 years of service and 591 district managers who average 14 years of service.

 CC0 ===============  [Compensation, Benefits and Recognition:] Just as pay, benefits, and growth opportunities are critically important to our Team Members’ success, we believe it is equally important to recognize Team Members for a job well done.

We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through various incentive compensation programs. Store team members have the opportunity to earn incentive pay that increases their base hourly wage consistent with their individual performance or the performance of their store. Store managers, district managers, region directors and division vice presidents have the ability to earn additional compensation above their salary or base hourly wage based upon the performance of their stores.

 CC1 ===============  [NOTE 5 – LEASES] The future minimum lease payments under the Company’s operating leases, in the table above, do not include potential amounts for percentage rent and other variable operating lease related costs and have not been reduced by expected future minimum sublease income under non-cancelable subleases, which was approximately $13.2 million as of December 31, 2022. The weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for the Company’s operating leases was 9.6 years and 4.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.
 CC2 ===============  [Gross profit:] Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 8% to $4.43 billion (or 30.7% of sales) from $4.10 billion (or 30.8% of sales) for the same period in 2021. The increase in total SG&A dollars for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of additional Team Members, facilities and vehicles to support our increased sales and store count, inflationary pressures on wages, benefits and fuel costs, as compared to the same period one year ago, and a non-cash charge associated with our transition to an enhanced paid time-off program for our Team Members. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, was principally due to leverage of fixed store operating costs on strong comparable store sales, partially offset by inflationary pressures on wages, benefits and fuel costs, as compared to the same period one year ago, and the charge associated with our transition to an enhanced paid time-off program.
 CC3 ===============  [Compensation, Benefits and Recognition:] Our compensation philosophy has always been to incentivize Team Members to “run it like you own it,” and we continually evaluate and benchmark our comprehensive compensation programs to ensure they remain competitive, providing an important tool to attract and retain the best and most qualified Team Members in every market.
