==========================================================={"label":"STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS","data":"We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition in the technology sector","data":"Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":"An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":"•We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":"A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":"•Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives."}
==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":"•We are investing in artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the entire company and infusing generative AI capabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny."}
==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":"Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model."}
==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":"•Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products."}
==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":"•Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using open source AI models, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products."}
==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":"The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives.

==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":"Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. Certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure IoT Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives."}
==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":"Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:"}

If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage."}
==========================================================={"label":"RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS","data":"We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like  Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality."}
==========================================================={"label":"RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS","data":"Developing new technologies is complex.

In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations."}
==========================================================={"label":"CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS","data":"Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position."}
==========================================================={"label":"Security of our information technology","data":"Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes  in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware."}
==========================================================={"label":"Security of our information technology","data":"Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software updates."}

We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because generative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments."}
==========================================================={"label":"Development and deployment of defensive measures","data":"To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other digital safety abuses","data":"Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or  disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other digital safety abuses","data":"The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT.  The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other digital safety abuses","data":"Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (“EU”), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"OPERATIONAL RISKS","data":"We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,  predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"OPERATIONAL RISKS","data":"We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs."}
==========================================================={"label":"OPERATIONAL RISKS","data":"Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge."}
==========================================================={"label":"OPERATIONAL RISKS","data":"There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins."}
==========================================================={"label":"LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS","data":"Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"For example, the European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our AI services in the European market."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services,  significant business transactions, warranty or product claims,  employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations,  or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS","data":"We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights."}
==========================================================={"label":"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS","data":"Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected."}
==========================================================={"label":"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS","data":"Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors."}
==========================================================={"label":"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS","data":"Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so."}

==========================================================={"label":"Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.","data":"Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased.

==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors."}

Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services,  impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":"Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives."}

Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment."}

We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand."}

First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs."}

They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities."}
==========================================================={"label":"Valuation","data":"In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio."}
==========================================================={"label":"Valuation","data":"A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate."}

The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard’s shareholders. We continue to work toward closing the transaction subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and  satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through October 18, 2023 to allow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other Planned Uses of Capital","data":"We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources."}
==========================================================={"label":"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES","data":"Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":"Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":"Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":"In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":"Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":"Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented."}
==========================================================={"label":"Impairment of Investment Securities","data":"We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments."}
==========================================================={"label":"Impairment of Investment Securities","data":"Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net."}
==========================================================={"label":"Goodwill","data":"We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit."}
==========================================================={"label":"Goodwill","data":"Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital."}
==========================================================={"label":"Goodwill","data":"The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit."}
==========================================================={"label":"Research and Development Costs","data":"Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products."}
==========================================================={"label":"Legal and Other Contingencies","data":"The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Income Taxes","data":"The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Inventories","data":"Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue."}

Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license."}
==========================================================={"label":"Nature of Products and Services","data":"Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time."}

Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided."}

==========================================================={"label":"Significant Judgments","data":"Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided."}

==========================================================={"label":"Item 8","data":"In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP."}

For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses."}
==========================================================={"label":"Contract Balances and Other Receivables","data":"Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service."}

In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront."}

For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years.

Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets."}

The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations."}
==========================================================={"label":"Investments","data":"Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments."}

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect.

The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence.

The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022.

In 2022, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts who are men, and that women outside the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts outside the U.S. who are men. In this year’s report, we again expanded our pay equity data beyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year), representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1","data":" In addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all employees regardless of factors such as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we continue to increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance."}

==========================================================={"label":"Competition in the technology sector","data":" We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":" An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. •We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":" A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":" •Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives."}

We expect AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny. Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model."}

The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. Certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure IoT Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives."}
==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":" Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: •Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints. Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. •Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.

If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income."}
==========================================================={"label":"RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS","data":" Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage. RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like  Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality."}
==========================================================={"label":"Activision Blizzard","data":" Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard , Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations."}
==========================================================={"label":"Security of our information technology","data":" Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes  in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware."}
==========================================================={"label":"Security of our information technology","data":" Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software updates."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide. 26 PART I Item 1A Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because generative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults."}
==========================================================={"label":"Development and deployment of defensive measures","data":" Cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other digital safety abuses","data":" Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or  disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other digital safety abuses","data":" The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT.  The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other digital safety abuses","data":" Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (“EU”), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"OPERATIONAL RISKS","data":" We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,  predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"OPERATIONAL RISKS","data":" We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge."}
==========================================================={"label":"OPERATIONAL RISKS","data":" There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. 30 PART I Item 1A For example, the European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our AI services in the European market."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services,  significant business transactions, warranty or product claims,  employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations,  or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made."}
==========================================================={"label":"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS","data":" We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. 33 PART I Item 1A INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights."}
==========================================================={"label":"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS","data":" Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors."}
==========================================================={"label":"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS","data":" Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so."}
==========================================================={"label":"GENERAL RISKS","data":" If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things: •Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content."}

If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees."}
==========================================================={"label":"Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.","data":" Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services,  impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives."}

==========================================================={"label":"Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks","data":" The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand."}

We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023."}
==========================================================={"label":"Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks","data":" On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs."}

Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Change in Accounting Estimate In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share."}

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.

They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities."}
==========================================================={"label":"Valuation","data":" In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio."}
==========================================================={"label":"Valuation","data":" A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate."}
==========================================================={"label":"Cash Flows","data":" Cash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment."}
==========================================================={"label":"Unearned Revenue","data":" We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.

Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $7.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2023.

(“Activision Blizzard”) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard’s shareholders. We continue to work toward closing the transaction subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and  satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through October 18, 2023 to allow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":" Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. 52 PART II Item 7 Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":" Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP."}
==========================================================={"label":"Impairment of Investment Securities","data":" Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments."}
==========================================================={"label":"Goodwill","data":" Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. 53 PART II Item 7 Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit."}
==========================================================={"label":"Goodwill","data":" Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit."}
==========================================================={"label":"Legal and Other Contingencies","data":" Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies"}
==========================================================={"label":"Income Taxes","data":" The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 54 PART II Item 7 Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"PART II","data":" Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. 55 PART II"}

==========================================================={"label":"Estimates and Assumptions","data":" Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties."}
==========================================================={"label":"Foreign Currencies","data":" In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $ 3.7 billion and net income of $ 3.0 billion, or $ 0.40 per both basic and diluted share. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":" Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. 63 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities."}
==========================================================={"label":"Nature of Products and Services","data":" Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time."}
==========================================================={"label":"Nature of Products and Services","data":" Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided."}
==========================================================={"label":"Significant Judgments","data":" Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 8","data":" Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP."}
==========================================================={"label":"Contract Balances and Other Receivables","data":" Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses."}
==========================================================={"label":"Contract Balances and Other Receivables","data":" Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period."}
==========================================================={"label":"Contract Balances and Other Receivables","data":" Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets."}

We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence."}
==========================================================={"label":"Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer","data":" We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities."}
==========================================================={"label":"Product Warranty","data":" Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. 66 PART II Item 8 Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary."}
==========================================================={"label":"Sales and Marketing","data":" Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $"}
==========================================================={"label":"Stock-Based Compensation","data":" Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase."}
==========================================================={"label":"Income Taxes","data":" On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets."}
==========================================================={"label":"Investments","data":" We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments."}
==========================================================={"label":"Derivatives","data":" Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation."}
==========================================================={"label":"Derivatives","data":" For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net."}
==========================================================={"label":"Fair Value Measurements","data":" We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: •Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts."}
==========================================================={"label":"Level 1","data":" – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. •Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.

Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities.

The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue."}
==========================================================={"label":"Leases","data":" Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three  years ; computer equipment, two to six years ; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years ; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years ; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years . Land is not depreciated. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 8","data":" ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term."}

For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed.

In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying."}

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion."}
==========================================================={"label":"Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting","data":" A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements."}

==========================================================={"label":"Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform","data":" As digital transformation and adoption of AI accelerates and revolutionizes more business workstreams, organizations in every sector across the globe can address challenges that will have a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. We continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. The Microsoft Cloud provides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from Internet of Things (“IoT”) sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. Our AI platform, Azure AI, is helping organizations transform, bringing intelligence and insights to the hands of their employees and customers to solve their most pressing challenges. Organizations large and small are deploying Azure AI solutions to achieve more at scale, more easily, with the proper enterprise-level and responsible AI protections. We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI, a leading AI research and deployment company. We deploy OpenAI’s models across our consumer and enterprise products.

As described in our 2022 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including: •Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity). Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and segments of our business. •Disability representation. Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity). •Pay equity (see details below). Disability representation. Total Rewards and Pay Equity Pay equity (see details below). Total Rewards and Pay Equity We develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive.

Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. Our total compensation opportunity is highly differentiated and is market competitive. In order to manage our costs in a dynamic, competitive environment, in fiscal year 2023 we announced that base salaries of salaried employees would remain at fiscal year 2022 levels.

We will continue our practice of investing in stock for all rewards-eligible employees, salaried and hourly, and investing in bonuses for all eligible employees."}
==========================================================={"label":"Wellbeing and Hybrid Work","data":" Since 2016, we have reported on pay equity as part of our annual Diversity and Inclusion report. In 2022, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts who are men, and that women outside the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts outside the U.S. who are men. In this year’s report, we again expanded our pay equity data beyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year), representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce. In addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all employees regardless of factors such as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we continue to increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellbeing and Hybrid Work Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ wellbeing while they are at work and in their personal lives. We have invested significantly in wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, disability accommodations, savings and investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders.

Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security. Azure  AI offerings provide a competitive advantage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. Azure’s purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure allows advanced models, including GPT-4 services designed for developers and data scientists, to do more with less. Customers can integrate large language models and develop the next generation of AI apps and services. Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product."}

RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS"}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":" We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. •We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform."}
==========================================================={"label":"Competition among platform-based ecosystems","data":" A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. •Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.

We expect AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and services necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny. Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. •Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products."}

==========================================================={"label":"Business model competition","data":" Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. Certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure IoT Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: •Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. •Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints. •Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs. Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. •Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.

If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage."}
==========================================================={"label":"RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS","data":" We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like  Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard , Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. 25 PART I Item 1A If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations."}
==========================================================={"label":"Security of our information technology","data":" Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes  in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software updates."}
==========================================================={"label":"Development and deployment of defensive measures","data":" Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. Cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other digital safety abuses","data":" We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 28 PART I Item 1A Other digital safety abuses Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or  disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Other digital safety abuses","data":" The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT.  The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (“EU”), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"OPERATIONAL RISKS","data":" We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. 30 PART I Item 1A For example, the European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws. Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our AI services in the European market."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services,  significant business transactions, warranty or product claims,  employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations,  or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS","data":" We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so."}
==========================================================={"label":"Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.","data":" If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things: •Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. •Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. 34 PART I Item 1A We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 1A","data":" Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services,  impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives."}

==========================================================={"label":"Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks","data":" Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. 40 PART II Item 7 Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand."}
==========================================================={"label":"Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks","data":" Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023. On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks."}
==========================================================={"label":"Metrics","data":" Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Change in Accounting Estimate In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share. 41 PART II Item 7 Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

==========================================================={"label":"Item 7","data":" In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion. Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. 48 PART II Item 7 As of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues.

The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures  exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results: Not meaningful. 49 PART II Item 7 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $111.3 billion and $104.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities."}
==========================================================={"label":"Valuation","data":" In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate."}
==========================================================={"label":"Unearned Revenue","data":" Cash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment. 50 PART II Item 7 Debt Proceeds We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.

Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $7.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2023. The remaining transition tax of $10.5 billion is payable over the next three years, with $2.7 billion payable within 12 months. In fiscal year 2023, we paid cash tax of $4.8 billion due to the mandatory capitalization for tax purposes of research and development expenditures enacted by the TCJA and effective on July 1, 2022. Share Repurchases During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 69 million shares and 95 million shares of our common stock for $18.4 billion and $28.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2023, $22.3 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program.

Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Other Planned Uses of Capital On January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard’s shareholders. We continue to work toward closing the transaction subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and  satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through October 18, 2023 to allow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":" Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers."}
==========================================================={"label":"Impairment of Investment Securities","data":" Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. 53"}
==========================================================={"label":"Research and Development Costs","data":" We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products."}
==========================================================={"label":"Inventories","data":" The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 54 PART II Item 7 Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue."}

The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. 56 PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA INCOME STATEMENTS Refer to accompanying notes. 58 PART II Item 8 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME STATEMENTS Refer to accompanying notes. 59 PART II Item 8 BALANCE SHEETS Refer to accompanying notes. 60 PART II Item 8 CASH FLOWS STATEMENTS Refer to accompanying notes. 61 PART II Item 8 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY STATEMENTS Refer to accompanying notes. 62 PART II Item 8 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties."}
==========================================================={"label":"Revenue Recognition","data":" In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $ 3.7 billion and net income of $ 3.0 billion, or $ 0.40 per both basic and diluted share. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. 63 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities."}
==========================================================={"label":"Nature of Products and Services","data":" Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided."}
==========================================================={"label":"Item 8","data":" Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 64 PART II Item 8 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services."}
==========================================================={"label":"Contract Balances and Other Receivables","data":" In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service."}

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 65 PART II Item 8 Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were $ 9.2 billion and $ 6.1 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, our financing receivables, net were $5.3 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence."}
==========================================================={"label":"Product Warranty","data":" We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. 66 PART II Item 8 Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary."}
==========================================================={"label":"Employee Severance","data":" Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 904 million , $ 1.5 billion, and $ 1.5 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Employee Severance On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information."}
==========================================================={"label":"Investments","data":" Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. 67 PART II Item 8 Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments."}
==========================================================={"label":"Fair Value Measurements","data":" Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. 68 PART II Item 8 Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:"}
==========================================================={"label":"Level 2","data":" •Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts. Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. •Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.

Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use,"}
==========================================================={"label":"Intangible Assets","data":" We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 69 PART II Item 8 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

Debt Investment Maturities 74 PART II Item 8 NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Interest Rate Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below."}

We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $ 620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016 The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes."}

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court.  A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying."}

==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%; and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%.\n\nResults exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions.\n\nIn Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations.\n\nIn gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share.\n\nA reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\n\nOperating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago.\n\nOperating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results.\n\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency.\n\nOffice 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments.\n\nSeat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\n\nOffice Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million.\n\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\n\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365.\n\nOperating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.\n\nRevenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%.\n\nAzure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition.\n\nIn our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.\n\nEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nResults were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets.\n\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products.\n\nOverall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge.\n\nAnd in gaming. Revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nResults were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in constant currency with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nXbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nGross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.

==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: Now back to total company results.\n\nCapital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion.\n\nCash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings.\n\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%.\n\nAnd finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point.\n\nWhen compared to our January guide for Q4, FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.\n\nIn commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases.\n\nWe continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion.\n\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency.\n\nWe continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\n\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.\n\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier.\n\nOur per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\n\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.\n\nNow I\u2019d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. "}
==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore, significant growth opportunities for years to come.\n\nIn FY2025, that focus on execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth to scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY2025 capital expenditures to be higher than FY2024. These expenditures over the course of the next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Financial Performance, Outlook, and Guidance", "data": "Amy Hood: We will also continue to prioritize operating leverage.\n\nAnd therefore, we expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI investments, as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our global customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year.\n\n"}

At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers.

And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers.\n\nSome of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Azure growth and demand trends", "data": "Satya Nadella: The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side."}

Great set of questions, Mark.\n\nLet me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what\u2019s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right?

==========================================================={"label": "The speaker discusses the impact of tools like Copilot on operating leverage and culture change within organizations.", "data": "Satya Nadella: Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right?\n\nThat\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board. "}
==========================================================={"label": "The speaker discusses the impact of tools like Copilot on operating leverage and culture change within organizations.", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The speaker discusses the impact of tools like Copilot on operating leverage and culture change within organizations.", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}
==========================================================={"label": "Transition of project starts to AI projects and other areas outside traditional IT budget spend", "data": "Amy Hood: And Mark, maybe to answer your question on, are we seeing project starts transition from maybe the \u2013 something that was core consumption to an AI project? In our results, that\u2019s not what we saw.\n\nWe saw more what Satya was speaking to earlier, which is, you see maybe growth in migrations again. You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

==========================================================={"label": "Capacity and demand imbalance impact on financial numbers", "data": "Amy Hood: So, you\u2019re absolutely right to start there, and it\u2019s a good question. The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular.\n\nAnd so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So, it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and it does impact a little bit the number in Q4."}

I have more conceptual question for Satya.\n\nIf you think about Copilots and what you're doing there, you're kind of impacting a lot of this in businesses and the opportunities seem very broad-based. How do you think this will play out in the industry between you guys offering certain Copilots versus like the rest of the industry following and everyone seems to have a Copilot now and seems to be talking about it.\n\nHow does that impact what do you want to do, your partner strategy going forward?

==========================================================={"label": "Integration of Copilot with business processes and enterprise data", "data": "Satya Nadella: And they do it inside of e-mail. They do it inside of Teams.\n\nThey do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you. Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data.\n\nSo when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

When you think about \u2013 we've been talking about sort of stabilization and what you saw this quarter, if you break down the Azure number as you saw, which I think I talked a little bit about with Karl was 7 points of contribution from AI, and you could call them the difference '24 from our core really Azure business.\n\nAnd within that, the activity we saw and the consumption side was really this balance that we were quite used to and have seen throughout the cloud transition. We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations.\n\nAnd then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal.\n\n"}

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question. And so then when you're saying do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization, I really do look sort of workload to workload.\n\nWhat are we seeing? "}

And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

==========================================================={"label": "Deployment of AI capabilities in enterprise business processes", "data": "Satya Nadella: So we feel good.\n\nAnd this is what I think on the commercial side, these are some of the harder problems to solve broad consumer, right? I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios.\n\nWhereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle.

It's the, AI \u2013 the user experience, scaffolding, the editor, the chat, then interpreter and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the entire thing work.\n\nAnd effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding.\n\nBut you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects."}

In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations.\n\nIn gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share.\n\nA reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\n\nOperating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago.\n\nOperating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results.\n\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency.\n\nOffice 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments.\n\nSeat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\n\nOffice Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million.\n\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\n\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365.\n\nOperating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.\n\nRevenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%.\n\nAzure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition.\n\nIn our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.\n\nEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%.\n\n"}

Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nResults were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets.\n\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products.\n\nOverall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge.\n\nAnd in gaming.

Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion.\n\nCash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings.\n\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%.\n\nAnd finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.\n\nIn commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases.\n\nWe continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand.

In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion.\n\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency.\n\nWe continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\n\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.\n\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier.\n\nOur per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\n\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility.

At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

==========================================================={"label": "investment in AI technology and capital allocation", "data": "Satya Nadella: I realize in the news, it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays.

And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process.\n\nAnd so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that."}

And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers.\n\nSome of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Azure's growth and trends related to AI projects and adjacent services", "data": "Satya Nadella: The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it.

So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right?\n\nThat\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board.

==========================================================={"label": "Shift of OpEx dollars into tool spend, cultural change inside organizations, impact on customer service, sales, marketing, and operations", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it.

==========================================================={"label": "Shift of OpEx dollars into tool spend, cultural change inside organizations, impact on customer service, sales, marketing, and operations", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}

You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular.\n\nAnd so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit.

Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data.\n\nSo when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios.\n\nWhereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle. Again, I point to get up, if you think about how it's got an entire system, right?\n\n"}

It's the, AI \u2013 the user experience, scaffolding, the editor, the chat, then interpreter and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the entire thing work.\n\nAnd effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding.\n\nBut you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects."}

So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side."}

At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share.\n\nA reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.

Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million.\n\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\n\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations.

As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year.\n\n"}

We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility.

At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers.

That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it.

That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right.

You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\n\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.\n\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier.\n\nOur per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\n\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year.\n\n"}

We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.\n\nNow I\u2019d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. "}

Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers.

We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI.

That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right.

It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data.\n\nSo when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right.

You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions.\n\nIn Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite.

In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations.\n\nIn gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share.\n\nA reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.

Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\n\nOperating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago.\n\nOperating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline.

Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency.\n\nOffice 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments.\n\nSeat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\n\nOffice Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million.\n\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\n\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365.\n\nOperating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.\n\nRevenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%.\n\nAzure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition.\n\nIn our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.\n\nEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services.

We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.\n\nIn commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year.

We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side."}

And what would be the leading indicators of that maturation?\n\nAnd Amy, am I characterizing this correctly as it relates to Azure?

Great set of questions, Mark.\n\nLet me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what\u2019s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right?

==========================================================={"label": "The subject is about the impact of technology on processes and the need for cultural and process change within organizations.", "data": "Satya Nadella: Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right?

==========================================================={"label": "The subject is about the impact of technology on processes and the need for cultural and process change within organizations.", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The subject is about the impact of technology on processes and the need for cultural and process change within organizations.", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}

In our results, that\u2019s not what we saw.\n\nWe saw more what Satya was speaking to earlier, which is, you see maybe growth in migrations again. You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations.\n\nAnd then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal.\n\n"}

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year.\n\n"}

We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility.

At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process.\n\nAnd so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that."}

Great set of questions, Mark.\n\nLet me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what\u2019s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right?

==========================================================={"label": "The impact of tools like Copilot on organizational processes and culture.", "data": "Satya Nadella: Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right?\n\nThat\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board.

==========================================================={"label": "The impact of tools like Copilot on organizational processes and culture.", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of tools like Copilot on organizational processes and culture.", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}

You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular.\n\nAnd so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So, it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and it does impact a little bit the number in Q4."}

That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations.\n\nAnd then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The subject of the current question is the Azure business performance and the balance between new workload starts and optimizations.", "data": "Amy Hood: We saw it again this quarter in a balanced way.

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

I mean if you sort of say this, what is this AI, it does two things, right?\n\nThere's a new user experience, there is a natural language interface and second thing is it's the reasoning engine. And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations.\n\nIn gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share.\n\nA reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.

Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\n\nOperating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago.\n\nOperating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline.

Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency.\n\nOffice 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments.\n\nSeat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\n\nOffice Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million.\n\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\n\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365.\n\nOperating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.\n\nRevenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%.\n\nAzure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition.\n\nIn our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.\n\nEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure.

We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.\n\nIn commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases.\n\nWe continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand.

In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion.\n\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency.\n\nWe continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\n\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.\n\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier.\n\nOur per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\n\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

==========================================================={"label": "Opportunity and size of cloud infrastructure", "data": "Amy Hood: Another thing that you\u2019ve really asked in the beginning was the opportunity and the size of that. And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process.\n\nAnd so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that."}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of AI on Azure and the trends playing out on the demand side", "data": "Satya Nadella: There are a couple of things I\u2019d say.\n\nOn the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the \u2013 we are fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a protocol for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers.\n\nSome of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of AI on Azure and the trends playing out on the demand side", "data": "Satya Nadella: The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it.

==========================================================={"label": "The impact of adopting new technology on workflow and process change", "data": "Satya Nadella: Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right?\n\nThat\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board. "}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of adopting new technology on workflow and process change", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of adopting new technology on workflow and process change", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}

You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular.\n\nAnd so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit.

That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations.\n\nAnd then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Azure performance and customer workload optimization", "data": "Amy Hood: We saw it again this quarter in a balanced way. And I think when we talk about stabilization or even what we saw between Q2 and Q3, which is a bit of acceleration in that core, was a lot of the newer project starts relating back to not just AI starts, but lots of other workflows.\n\nThe companies are still going from on-prem to cloud, Satya mentioned migrations. And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question. And so then when you're saying do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization, I really do look sort of workload to workload.\n\nWhat are we seeing? "}
==========================================================={"label": "Azure performance and customer workload optimization", "data": "Amy Hood: Where it starts?\n\nAnd this one actually felt quite balanced and optimization looks like they normally would, which by the way, is super important. It's something we encourage customers to do.\n\nYou want to run your workloads as efficiently as you possibly can. It's critical to customers being able to grow and get value out of that.\n\nSo I sometimes think we \u2013 you all may ask the question more as a negative. And for us, it's just about a healthy cycle at the customer account level."}
==========================================================={"label": "Deployment of new AI capabilities in the enterprise", "data": "Satya Nadella: Yes, it's a great question because there are two sets of things in order to make sense for successful deployment of these new AI capabilities. I mean if you sort of say this, what is this AI, it does two things, right?\n\nThere's a new user experience, there is a natural language interface and second thing is it's the reasoning engine. And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing. "}
==========================================================={"label": "Deployment of new AI capabilities in the enterprise", "data": "Satya Nadella: So we feel good.\n\nAnd this is what I think on the commercial side, these are some of the harder problems to solve broad consumer, right? I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios.\n\nWhereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle. Again, I point to get up, if you think about how it's got an entire system, right?\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Deployment of new AI capabilities in the enterprise", "data": "Satya Nadella: It's just not an AI model. It's the, AI \u2013 the user experience, scaffolding, the editor, the chat, then interpreter and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the entire thing work.\n\nAnd effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding.\n\nBut you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects."}
==========================================================={"label": "capacity constraints on the Copilots and Azure infrastructure", "data": "Amy Hood: It's a good opportunity to clarify.\n\nAnd I would not say that there is a capacity constraint on the Copilots. It's a real priority for us to make sure we optimize the allocation of our capacity to make sure that those per user businesses are able to continue to grow.\n\nAnd so think about that as our priority one. And so then what that does mean is capacity constraints when we have them, you'll tend to see them on the Azure infrastructure side, the consumption side of the business is a better way of thinking about it"}

And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year.\n\n"}

We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.\n\nNow I\u2019d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. "}

At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

==========================================================={"label": "capital allocation for AI leadership", "data": "Satya Nadella: I realize in the news, it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays.

And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process.\n\nAnd so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that."}

And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers.\n\nSome of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The growth and trends of Azure in relation to AI and adjacent services, as well as migrations to Azure", "data": "Satya Nadella: The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it.

Great set of questions, Mark.\n\nLet me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what\u2019s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right?

==========================================================={"label": "The impact of Copilot on workflow and process change within organizations", "data": "Satya Nadella: Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right?\n\nThat\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board. "}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of Copilot on workflow and process change within organizations", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of Copilot on workflow and process change within organizations", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}
==========================================================={"label": "Transition of project starts to AI projects and other areas outside of traditional IT budget spend", "data": "Amy Hood: And Mark, maybe to answer your question on, are we seeing project starts transition from maybe the \u2013 something that was core consumption to an AI project?

You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular.\n\nAnd so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit.

That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations.\n\nAnd then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal.\n\n"}

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

Our third quarter revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%; and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%.\n\nResults exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions.\n\nIn Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Q&A session", "data": "Amy Hood: And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations.\n\nIn gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share.\n\nA reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\n\nOperating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago.\n\nOperating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results.\n\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency.\n\nOffice 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments.\n\nSeat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\n\nOffice Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million.\n\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\n\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365.\n\nOperating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.\n\nRevenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%.\n\nAzure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition.\n\nIn our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.\n\nEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Q&A session", "data": "Amy Hood: Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nResults were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets.\n\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products.\n\nOverall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge.\n\nAnd in gaming. Revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nResults were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in constant currency with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nXbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nGross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.

==========================================================={"label": "Q&A session", "data": "Amy Hood: Now back to total company results.\n\nCapital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion.\n\nCash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings.\n\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%.\n\nAnd finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Q&A session", "data": "Amy Hood: Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point.\n\nWhen compared to our January guide for Q4, FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.\n\nIn commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases.\n\nWe continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Q&A session", "data": "Amy Hood: Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion.\n\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency.\n\nWe continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\n\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.\n\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier.\n\nOur per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\n\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Q&A session", "data": "Amy Hood: Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.\n\nNow I\u2019d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. "}
==========================================================={"label": "Q&A session", "data": "Amy Hood: We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore, significant growth opportunities for years to come.\n\nIn FY2025, that focus on execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth to scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY2025 capital expenditures to be higher than FY2024. These expenditures over the course of the next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Q&A session", "data": "Amy Hood: We will also continue to prioritize operating leverage.\n\nAnd therefore, we expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI investments, as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our global customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "AI leadership and capital allocation", "data": "Satya Nadella: Thank you, Keith for the question, let me start and then Amy, you can add. At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years. "}
==========================================================={"label": "AI leadership and capital allocation", "data": "Satya Nadella: I realize in the news, it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays. But if you look at it, we have been doing what is essentially capital allocation to be a leader in AI for multiple years now, and we plan to sort of essentially keep taking that forward."}
==========================================================={"label": "Opportunity and size of business process impact in cloud infrastructure", "data": "Amy Hood: And Keith, I do think it's important to really think about our planning cycles and we do talk about spending sequentially higher. And we look forward to being able to continue to build out the infrastructure needed to meet the demand.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Opportunity and size of business process impact in cloud infrastructure", "data": "Amy Hood: Another thing that you\u2019ve really asked in the beginning was the opportunity and the size of that. And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process.\n\nAnd so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that."}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of Azure on AI projects and customer acquisition", "data": "Satya Nadella: There are a couple of things I\u2019d say.\n\nOn the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the \u2013 we are fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a protocol for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers.\n\nSome of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of Azure on AI projects and customer acquisition", "data": "Satya Nadella: The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side."}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on workflow and process change within organizations", "data": "Satya Nadella: Yes. Great set of questions, Mark.\n\nLet me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what\u2019s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right? I mean if you think about it, they bought tools in the past.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on workflow and process change within organizations", "data": "Satya Nadella: Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right?\n\nThat\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board. "}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on workflow and process change within organizations", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on workflow and process change within organizations", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}
==========================================================={"label": "Transition of project starts to AI projects and spending in other areas", "data": "Amy Hood: And Mark, maybe to answer your question on, are we seeing project starts transition from maybe the \u2013 something that was core consumption to an AI project? In our results, that\u2019s not what we saw.\n\nWe saw more what Satya was speaking to earlier, which is, you see maybe growth in migrations again. You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing. "}
==========================================================={"label": "Capacity and demand for inferencing side", "data": "Amy Hood: So, you\u2019re absolutely right to start there, and it\u2019s a good question. The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular.\n\nAnd so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So, it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and it does impact a little bit the number in Q4."}
==========================================================={"label": "Impact of Copilots on the industry and partner strategy", "data": "Raimo Lenschow: Thank you. I have more conceptual question for Satya.\n\nIf you think about Copilots and what you're doing there, you're kind of impacting a lot of this in businesses and the opportunities seem very broad-based. How do you think this will play out in the industry between you guys offering certain Copilots versus like the rest of the industry following and everyone seems to have a Copilot now and seems to be talking about it.\n\nHow does that impact what do you want to do, your partner strategy going forward? "}
==========================================================={"label": "Integration of Copilot with business processes and data", "data": "Satya Nadella: Yes, it's a great question. So the way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes, right?\n\nSo it's not like \u2013 when people do knowledge work, they're not doing knowledge work, they're doing knowledge work and support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service, revenue ops, supply chain or what have you, right?

They do it inside of Teams.\n\nThey do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you. Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data.\n\nSo when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

==========================================================={"label": "Integration of Copilot with business processes and data", "data": "Satya Nadella: And so now you can access all that data right in the Team's context.\n\nSo that's I think what's exciting for us, having built all these horizontal tools, which I would say we're under underappreciated for the amount of work. How people use those tools to make progress on business process, but we now get to bridge that between the business applications and knowledge worker tools, tomorrow horizontally."}
==========================================================={"label": "The subject of the current question is about the balance and stabilization of Azure business, including the contribution from AI and core Azure business, workload starts, optimizations, and the transition from on-prem to cloud for companies.", "data": "Amy Hood: It's a little easier to address them. When you think about \u2013 we've been talking about sort of stabilization and what you saw this quarter, if you break down the Azure number as you saw, which I think I talked a little bit about with Karl was 7 points of contribution from AI, and you could call them the difference '24 from our core really Azure business.\n\nAnd within that, the activity we saw and the consumption side was really this balance that we were quite used to and have seen throughout the cloud transition. We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations.\n\nAnd then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The subject of the current question is about the balance and stabilization of Azure business, including the contribution from AI and core Azure business, workload starts, optimizations, and the transition from on-prem to cloud for companies.", "data": "Amy Hood: We saw it again this quarter in a balanced way. And I think when we talk about stabilization or even what we saw between Q2 and Q3, which is a bit of acceleration in that core, was a lot of the newer project starts relating back to not just AI starts, but lots of other workflows.\n\nThe companies are still going from on-prem to cloud, Satya mentioned migrations. And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question. And so then when you're saying do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization, I really do look sort of workload to workload.\n\nWhat are we seeing? "}
==========================================================={"label": "The subject of the current question is about the balance and stabilization of Azure business, including the contribution from AI and core Azure business, workload starts, optimizations, and the transition from on-prem to cloud for companies.", "data": "Amy Hood: Where it starts?\n\nAnd this one actually felt quite balanced and optimization looks like they normally would, which by the way, is super important. It's something we encourage customers to do.\n\nYou want to run your workloads as efficiently as you possibly can. It's critical to customers being able to grow and get value out of that.\n\nSo I sometimes think we \u2013 you all may ask the question more as a negative. And for us, it's just about a healthy cycle at the customer account level."}
==========================================================={"label": "The successful deployment of new AI capabilities, including natural language interface, reasoning engine, and the need for good grounding data.", "data": "Satya Nadella: Yes, it's a great question because there are two sets of things in order to make sense for successful deployment of these new AI capabilities. I mean if you sort of say this, what is this AI, it does two things, right?\n\nThere's a new user experience, there is a natural language interface and second thing is it's the reasoning engine. And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing. "}
==========================================================={"label": "The successful deployment of new AI capabilities, including natural language interface, reasoning engine, and the need for good grounding data.", "data": "Satya Nadella: So we feel good.\n\nAnd this is what I think on the commercial side, these are some of the harder problems to solve broad consumer, right? I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios.\n\nWhereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle. Again, I point to get up, if you think about how it's got an entire system, right?\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The successful deployment of new AI capabilities, including natural language interface, reasoning engine, and the need for good grounding data.", "data": "Satya Nadella: It's just not an AI model. It's the, AI \u2013 the user experience, scaffolding, the editor, the chat, then interpreter and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the entire thing work.\n\nAnd effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding.\n\nBut you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects."}
==========================================================={"label": "Capacity constraints on Copilots and Azure infrastructure", "data": "Amy Hood: It's a good opportunity to clarify.\n\nAnd I would not say that there is a capacity constraint on the Copilots. It's a real priority for us to make sure we optimize the allocation of our capacity to make sure that those per user businesses are able to continue to grow.\n\nAnd so think about that as our priority one. And so then what that does mean is capacity constraints when we have them, you'll tend to see them on the Azure infrastructure side, the consumption side of the business is a better way of thinking about it"}
==========================================================={"label": "The subject of the question is about the trends playing out on Azure, particularly around AI projects, Azure Search, Cosmos DB, and migrations to Azure.", "data": "Satya Nadella: There are a couple of things I\u2019d say.\n\nOn the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the \u2013 we are fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a protocol for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers.\n\nSome of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The subject of the question is about the trends playing out on Azure, particularly around AI projects, Azure Search, Cosmos DB, and migrations to Azure.", "data": "Satya Nadella: The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side."}

We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.\n\nIn commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases.\n\nWe continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand.

In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion.\n\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency.\n\nWe continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\n\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.\n\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier.\n\nOur per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\n\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers.

That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it.

That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}

That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion.\n\nCash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings.\n\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%.\n\nAnd finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S.\n\n"}

We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.\n\nIn commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases.\n\nWe continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity.\n\n"}

In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion.\n\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency.\n\nWe continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\n\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.\n\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier.\n\nOur per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\n\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility.

==========================================================={"label": "Investment in AI technology and strategy", "data": "Satya Nadella: Thank you, Keith for the question, let me start and then Amy, you can add. At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

==========================================================={"label": "Investment in AI technology and strategy", "data": "Satya Nadella: I realize in the news, it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays.

==========================================================={"label": "The opportunity and size of the cloud infrastructure business", "data": "Amy Hood: And Keith, I do think it's important to really think about our planning cycles and we do talk about spending sequentially higher.

==========================================================={"label": "The opportunity and size of the cloud infrastructure business", "data": "Amy Hood: Another thing that you\u2019ve really asked in the beginning was the opportunity and the size of that. And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process.\n\nAnd so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that."}
==========================================================={"label": "Azure growth trends", "data": "Satya Nadella: There are a couple of things I\u2019d say.\n\nOn the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the \u2013 we are fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a protocol for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers.\n\nSome of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "Azure growth trends", "data": "Satya Nadella: The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side."}

Great set of questions, Mark.\n\nLet me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what\u2019s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right?

==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on business processes and the need for cultural/ process change", "data": "Satya Nadella: Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you\u2019re spending today, right?\n\nThat\u2019s really a good example of, I think, what\u2019s going to happen across the board. "}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on business processes and the need for cultural/ process change", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on business processes and the need for cultural/ process change", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}

You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

==========================================================={"label": "Capacity and demand balance on the inferencing side", "data": "Amy Hood: So, you\u2019re absolutely right to start there, and it\u2019s a good question. The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular.\n\nAnd so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So, it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and it does impact a little bit the number in Q4."}

Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data.\n\nSo when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right?\n\nSo people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful.\n\nAnd then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.

That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding.\n\nBut you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects."}

In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions.\n\nIn Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion.\n\n"}

In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations.\n\nIn gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share.\n\nA reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%.\n\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\n\nOperating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago.\n\nOperating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results.\n\nRevenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency.\n\nOffice 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments.\n\nSeat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\n\nOffice Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million.\n\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\n\nDynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated.\n\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365.\n\nOperating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment.\n\nRevenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%.\n\nAzure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.

In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.\n\nEnterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services.

Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets.\n\nWindows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products.\n\nOverall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge.\n\nAnd in gaming. Revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nResults were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty.

Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion.\n\nCash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings.\n\nThis quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%.\n\nAnd finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point.\n\nIn commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases.\n\nWe continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand.

In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion.\n\nIn Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency.\n\nWe continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens.\n\nIn Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.\n\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth.\n\nFor Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier.\n\nOur per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\n\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services.\n\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts.\n\nIn Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength.\n\nThis will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.\n\nWe expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.

Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\n\nThis operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method.\n\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility.

You\u2019re seeing work in the data space, again, and you\u2019re seeing AI project starts.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it\u2019s about spending maybe in other areas that we don\u2019t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO.\n\nIt\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it\u2019s spend being done by the Head of Marketing.

The way to think about it is a bit more by \u2013 it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular.\n\nAnd so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So, it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and it does impact a little bit the number in Q4."}
==========================================================={"label": "Capital allocation for AI leadership", "data": "Satya Nadella: Thank you, Keith for the question, let me start and then Amy, you can add. At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right?\n\nThere is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side.\n\nWe want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward.\n\nThen Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure.\n\nAnd it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track \u2013 we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely.\n\nSo we feel \u2013 and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years.

And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process.\n\nAnd so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of \u201ccloud infrastructure\u201d is important.\n\nIt's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade.\n\nWatch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that."}

So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database.\n\nIn fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI.\n\nAnd so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction.\n\nSo, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well.\n\nSo, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also \u2013 as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize.\n\nSo, it's a continuous side of it.

==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on workflow and process change, specifically related to the adoption of Copilot", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see that in customer service.\n\nWe see that in sales. We see that in marketing.\n\nAnywhere, there\u2019s operations. That\u2019s why I described it as knowledge turns.\n\nYou can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations.\n\nWhen I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions.\n\nAnd so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences.\n\nSo, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We\u2019re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process.\n\nAnd we know that this is not just about technology, it\u2019s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development.\n\n"}
==========================================================={"label": "The impact of technology on workflow and process change, specifically related to the adoption of Copilot", "data": "Satya Nadella: We see it in customer service. We\u2019re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize.\n\nAnd so, that\u2019s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That\u2019s the closest analogy I can come up with.\n\nAnd so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It\u2019s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change."}

Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data.\n\nSo when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing.\n\nIn fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions.\n\nAnd net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process.\n\nIt could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do.

And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects.\n\nThis is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos.\n\nSo I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question.

So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises.\n\nSo all that's maturing.
