 ==={'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Tesla Inc. is a company with a mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. They design, develop, manufacture, lease, and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products. In addition to these, Tesla also offers maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial, and other services related to their products. The company is increasingly focusing on products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation.<br>In terms of financial performance, Tesla's automotive cost of revenues was $66,389 million, with energy generation and storage revenues at $4,894 million, and services and other revenues at $7,830 million. The total cost of revenues was $79,113 million, and the gross profit was $17,660 million. The company's operating expenses included $3,969 million for research and development and $4,800 million for selling, general, and administrative expenses. The income from operations was $8,891 million, and the net income was $14,974 million.<br>In the first quarter, Tesla had a negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion due to an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries and elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute. However, they expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again.<br>As part of their future outlook, Tesla is preparing for the next phase of growth, which unfortunately involved a hard but necessary decision to reduce their headcount by over 10%. They are also expecting their storage deployments to contribute significantly to their overall profitability, despite some fluctuations quarter-over-quarter due to factors outside their control."}
