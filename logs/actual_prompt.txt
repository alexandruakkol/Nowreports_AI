The decrease was primarily attributable to the increased benefit of taxes on non-U.S. earnings and lower expense related to unremitted withholding taxes on non-U.S. earnings, partially offset by incremental tax expense for reserves. The Company’s 2023 non-U.S. effective tax rate was 25.3%, a decrease of approximately 2.2 percentage points compared to 2022.

The effective tax rate decreased by 0.4 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily a result of additional tax expense reported in 2021 arising from a valuation allowance established against a capital loss, partially offset by a tax benefit related to restructuring transactions. In 2022, the valuation allowance was partially released as losses were utilized against a capital gain. Additionally, in 2022, there was lower tax expense reported for contingencies as a result of the release of certain state income tax reserves. The Company’s 2022 non-U.S. effective tax rate was 27.5%, an increase of approximately 1.5 percentage points compared to 2021. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a 2021 tax benefit recorded for the release of a valuation allowance on net operating losses due to restructuring in Canada, which resulted in more tax expense in 2022 compared to 2021.

The competition for talent has become increasingly intense and we may experience increased employee turnover due to a tightening labor market. If we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, the Company could encounter operating challenges primarily due to a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, errors due to inexperience, or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel. In addition, higher costs could result from loss of productivity, increased safety compliance issues, or cost of contract labor. Additionally, our ability to operate is contingent on maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working environment. As a provider of essential services, we have an obligation to provide natural gas services to customers. Incidents that impact the health and availability of our workforce could threaten the continuity of our business operations. Natural disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results. Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also, companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited, which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results. Technology and Cybersecurity Risks Increased dependence on technology may hinder the Company’s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail. Over the last several years, the Company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including scheduling and dispatching of service technicians, automated meter reading systems, customer care and billing, operational plant logistics, management reporting and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company’s inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations."}'}
