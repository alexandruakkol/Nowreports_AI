Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.,  [2023 2022 2021 Net sales: U.S. $ 138,573 $ 147,859 $ 133,803 China (1) 72,559 74,200 68,366 Other countries 172,153 172,269 163,648 Total net sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817] assets:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>U.S.</td><td>$</td><td>33,276</td><td></td><td></td><td>$</td><td>31,119</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>China (1)</td><td>5,778</td><td></td><td></td><td>7,260</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Other,  [2023 2022 2021 Net sales: U.S. $ 138,573 $ 147,859 $ 133,803 China (1) 72,559 74,200 68,366 Other countries 172,153 172,269 163,648 Total net sales $ 383,285 $ 394,328 $ 365,817] <table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2023</td><td></td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Long-lived,  Net sales for 2023, 2022 and 2021 and long-lived assets as of September\xa03] <table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2023</td><td></td><td>2022</td><td></td><td>2021</td></tr><tr,  [The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):] China:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Net sales</td><td>$</td><td>72,559</td><td></td><td></td><td>$</td><td>74,200</td><td></td><td></td><td>$</td><td>68,366</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating' name=None tool_calls=None

This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries.

 ===================================================role='user' content='does the company increase its hedging [CONTEXT]:  [Financial Risks] The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.,  [Derivative Instruments and Hedging] The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.,  [Financial Risks] The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.,  [Financial Risks] The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.,  [The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\xa030, 2023 and September\xa024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):] <table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2023</td><td></td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Hedged,  [Interest Rate Risk] To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.,  [Foreign Exchange Rate Risk] To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.,  [General Risks] The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.,  [The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\xa030, 2023 and September\xa024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):] assets/(liabilities):</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current and non-current marketable securities</td><td>$</td><td>14,433</td><td></td><td></td><td>$</td><td>13,378</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current and non-current term,  [Interest Rate Risk] The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt.

Unfortunately, the balance sheet does not provide the net PP&E for 2023, only the gross PP&E ($132,831 million in 2023 and $122,831 million in 2022). Without further information, it\'s difficult to accurately estimate the CapEx.<br><br>However, if we assume that the company\'s CapEx is around the same level as the previous year ($16,284 million in 2022), we can estimate the free cash flow as follows:<br>Free Cash Flow = CFO - CapEx<br>Free Cash Flow = $110,543 million - $16,284 million<br>Free Cash Flow = $94,259 million<br><br>Please note that this is an approximation, and the actual free cash flow may be different depending on the company\'s actual CapEx.' name=None tool_calls=None

 ===================================================role='assistant' content="Based on the provided financial report, the company is exposed to several risks related to vendors and customers:<br>1. Concentration of trade receivables: A significant portion of the company's trade receivables is concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers, and a majority of these receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance.<br>2. Vendor non-trade receivables: The company has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, which are concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia.<br>3. Supplier risks: The company's manufacturing is heavily outsourced to partners in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, with a significant concentration of manufacturing performed by a small number of these partners. This reduces the company's direct control over production and distribution, potentially affecting product quality, quantity, and flexibility in responding to changing conditions.<br>4. Credit risk: The company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables, and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, with this risk being heightened during periods of economic downturn.<br>5. Confidentiality risks: The company shares confidential information with suppliers and other third parties, and despite measures to secure this information, losses or unauthorized access can still occur, potentially impacting the company's business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.<br>6. Reseller risks: Investments in programs to enhance reseller sales, such as staffing resellers' stores with company employees and contractors, can require substantial investments without assuring return or incremental sales.

While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.,  [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7] Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “,  [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7] The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.,  [Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product] Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.,  [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12] Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.,  [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13] Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.,  [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7] The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.,  [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10] The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.,  [Supply of Components] Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources.,  [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7] The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.,  [Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks] The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.' name=None tool_calls=None

The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.,  [Interest Rate Risk] The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\xa030, 2023 and September\xa024, 2022 (dollars in millions):,  [Financial Risks] The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.,  [Derivative Instruments and Hedging] The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.,  [Term Debt] The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized $3.7 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion of interest expense on its term debt for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.,  [The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\xa030, 2023 and September\xa024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):] <table><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2023</td><td></td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Hedged assets/(liabilities):</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current and non-current marketable securities</td><td>$</td><td>14,433</td><td></td><td></td><td>$</td><td>13,378</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current and non-current term debt</td><td>$</td><td>( 18,247 )</td><td></td><td></td><td>$</td><td>( 18,739 )</td><td></td></tr></table>,  [Interest Rate Risk] The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.,  [General Risks] The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.,  [Foreign Exchange Rate Risk] To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.,  [PART II] The Company’s common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol AAPL.,  [Interest Rate Risk] To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments.

The iPhone line includes iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13 and iPhone SE,  [Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks] While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.,  [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13] The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.,  [Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks] Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.' name=None tool_calls=None

The iPhone line includes iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13 and iPhone SE, [Note 2 – Revenue] The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, [Products and Services Performance] Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products., [Business Seasonality and Product Introductions] The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction., [Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7] The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales., [, Siri] For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains., [Business Risks] Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.' name=None tool_calls=None

 ==================================================={'role': 'system', 'content': "Objective: The assistant should be capable of analyzing data, performing calculations, identifying potential risks, and providing actionable insights to the user, based on the provided data from the company's financial report, while summarizing and keeping the responses short. Scenario: Imagine you are an executive at a corporation responsible for fairly and briefly answering to your shareholders and their concerns. You are pragmatic and you cut the bullshit. Only communicate the important body of your message, keep the fluff away. If you cannot find the data the user is asking for, just say so and stop. Technique: If the task is complex, split it into subtasks. Structure your responses into brief, pragmatic, short and easy to understand points. Run a math check of your prompt. Do not add comments if the question is specific, and you have already given the answer. If exact data cannot be found in the provided financial document, say so. Do not cite sources unless asked. Write in markdown format. Try to answer in table form."}

 ==================================================={'role': 'system', 'content': "Objective: The assistant should be capable of analyzing data, performing calculations, identifying potential risks, and providing actionable insights to the user, based on the provided data from the company's financial report, while summarizing and keeping the responses short. Scenario: Imagine you are an executive at a corporation responsible for fairly and briefly answering to your shareholders and their concerns. You are pragmatic and you cut the bullshit. Only communicate the important body of your message, keep the fluff away. If you cannot find the data the user is asking for, just say so and stop. Technique: If the task is complex, split it into subtasks. Structure your responses into brief, pragmatic, short and easy to understand points. Run a math check of your prompt. Do not add comments if the question is specific, and you have already given the answer. If exact data cannot be found in the provided financial document, say so. Do not cite sources unless asked. Write in markdown format. Try to answer in table form."}

Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.
